# Research & Development — Structure

Planning doc for the `/research-and-development` surface — the home of Qatoto's full
**concept-to-consumer pipeline**: market-demand research → problem mapping → team
building (equity for skills) → build with AI-analyzed daily logs → transparent
funding & escrow governance → go-to-market. The landing page tells the whole
pipeline story; deep features live on sub-routes. Tweak / delete anything; we build
only what survives.

> **Phase note:** UI + mock data only. No backend, no fetch, no Zod, no loading/error
> states, no new abstractions. Every number on this surface (funding, equity, escrow,
> AI analysis, opportunity scores, demand stats) is a **static mock**; every
> interaction mutates local client state only. Escrow, compensation math, AI log
> analysis, and verification are **backend-owned later** — the frontend only renders
> them (thin-client invariant, `CLAUDE.md` §Core principle).

Pattern donors elsewhere in the repo:

- **Component decomposition**: [src/components/home/store/](src/components/home/store/) — `pages/ rails/ cards/ sections/ sheets/`; landing composes rails like [store-page.tsx](src/components/home/store/pages/store-page.tsx).
- **Dynamic route under `cacheComponents: true`**: [store/product/[id]/page.tsx](<src/app/(home)/store/product/[id]/page.tsx>) — `generateStaticParams` is **required** or the build breaks.
- **Mock data shape**: [src/types/store.ts](src/types/store.ts) + [src/lib/store-mocks.ts](src/lib/store-mocks.ts) — but R&D takes **mocks only, no fetch/getter layer** (phase rule).

## 2. The pipeline in one picture

The founder's eight pillars, and which surface carries each:

| #   | Pillar                                              | Carried by                                                                           |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Market-demand research & feasibility                | `/research-and-development/knowledge-hub` + demand chips on project Overview         |
| 2   | Problem Mapping / "Civic Pulse"                     | `/research-and-development/problem-map`                                              |
| 3   | Knowledge Hub (market intelligence)                 | `/research-and-development/knowledge-hub`                                            |
| 4   | Talent matching / Virtual Workshop                  | Open-roles rail + Team tab now; `/talent` + `/workshop` later (§11)                  |
| 5   | Funding (crowd / VC, transparency)                  | Funding tab on project detail; investor `/funding` view later (§11)                  |
| 6   | Daily Update Protocol (AI logs, Proof of Effort)    | Daily Logs tab on project detail                                                     |
| 7   | Financial governance (escrow, anti-corruption)      | Governance tab on project detail                                                     |
| 8   | Go-to-market (suppliers, ODM, shipping, storefront) | Pipeline-stage card pointing at the existing **`/store`** B2B surface — no new route |

Related surfaces that are **not** part of this doc:

- **Anime** (`/anime`) — the creative-inspiration R&D feed. Already built; the landing may reference it in copy only.
- **Project Immortal** (`/project-immortal`) — moonshot research. Featured banner on the landing links to the existing stub; full structure in its own future doc.

## 3. Route map

```text
/research-and-development                        ✅ built — pipeline hub landing
/research-and-development/project/[id]           ✅ built — project detail (5 tabs)
/research-and-development/problem-map            ✅ built — Civic Pulse map + reports
/research-and-development/knowledge-hub          ✅ built — market intelligence
--- later (specced in §11, teased by rails/sheets now) ---
/research-and-development/talent                 ➕ later — browse people trading skills for equity
/research-and-development/funding                ➕ later — investor deal-flow view
/research-and-development/project/[id]/workshop  ➕ later — Virtual Workshop collab space
/research-and-development/new                    ➕ later — multi-step idea wizard (sheet for now)
```

| Route                                      | Purpose                                                                       | Phase    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `/research-and-development`                | Landing: whole pipeline story + rails into every sub-surface                  | ✅ built |
| `/research-and-development/project/[id]`   | One project's full lifecycle: overview, daily logs, team, funding, governance | ✅ built |
| `/research-and-development/problem-map`    | World map of reported infrastructure gaps → opportunity heat map              | ✅ built |
| `/research-and-development/knowledge-hub`  | Where demand is highest: insights, demand leaderboard, trends                 | ✅ built |
| `/talent`, `/funding`, `/workshop`, `/new` | See §11                                                                       | ➕ later |

Route decisions baked in:

- **Project detail is one route with client-state tabs**, not nested tab segments — nested
  segments under `[id]` each need `generateStaticParams` plumbing and buy nothing in a
  mock phase (revisit in §12 Q4).
- **Detail nests under `/project/`** so the dynamic segment cannot collide with the
  static `problem-map` / `knowledge-hub` segments (mirrors `/store/product/[id]`).
- **Idea submission is a sheet, not a route** — the store surface already leans on
  sheets; promote to `/new` when it grows into a wizard (§12 Q3).
- **`[id]` must export `generateStaticParams`** (cacheComponents constraint). No getter
  layer this phase, so the route imports the mock array directly:

```typescript
import { MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS } from "@/lib/research-and-development-mocks";

export function generateStaticParams() {
    return MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS.map((project) => ({ id: project.id }));
}
```

## 4. Landing — `/research-and-development`

Top-to-bottom composition (server component, mirrors [store-page.tsx](src/components/home/store/pages/store-page.tsx)):

| #   | Section                                                 | Purpose / content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Mock needs                                                                | Keep? |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 4.1 | **Hero band** (`pipeline-hero`)                         | "From concept to consumer." One-paragraph pitch + two CTAs: **Post your idea** (opens sheet §8.1) and **Explore projects** (anchor to 4.3)                                                                                                                              | Static copy, one `/public/dummy/*.avif` background                        |       |
| 4.2 | **Pipeline stages strip** (`pipeline-stages-strip`)     | Horizontal scroll of **6 stage cards** condensing the 8 pillars: Market Research → Problem Mapping → Team Building → Build & Daily Logs → Funding & Governance → Go-to-Market. Each: icon, one-line blurb, link (knowledge-hub / problem-map / project tabs / `/store`) | Static `PIPELINE_STAGES` array inline in the component                    |       |
| 4.3 | **Featured projects rail** (`projects-rail`)            | The main event. `ProjectCard`s: cover, name, tagline, stage badge, funding progress bar, team avatar stack, open-roles count → `/project/[id]`                                                                                                                          | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS` (~6, spanning all stages so every badge appears) |       |
| 4.4 | **Problem map teaser** (`problem-map-preview`)          | Split: left, stylized map thumbnail with 3–4 pins; right, "Top reported gaps" list (location, category, report count, opportunity score). CTA → `/problem-map`                                                                                                          | Top slice of `MOCK_PROBLEM_REPORTS`                                       |       |
| 4.5 | **Market insights rail** (`market-insights-rail`)       | `MarketInsightCard`s: headline stat ("Demand for off-grid cold storage up 34% in East Africa"), trend arrow, region + category chips. CTA → `/knowledge-hub`                                                                                                            | `MOCK_MARKET_INSIGHTS`                                                    |       |
| 4.6 | **Open roles rail** (`open-roles-rail`)                 | "Join a team for equity": role title, project name, skill chips, equity range, commitment tag, **Express interest** button (client toggle → "Interest sent"). Carries pillar 4 until `/talent` exists                                                                   | `MOCK_OPEN_ROLES` joined to projects                                      |       |

## 5. Project detail — `/research-and-development/project/[id]`

**Header (always visible above tabs):** cover image band; name + tagline; stage badge +
category chips; founder avatar + name; stats row (raised % of goal, team size,
daily-log streak days, watchers); action buttons **Request to join** and **Back this
project** (client toggles — see §9).

**Tab bar** — 5 tabs, client state, rendered via exhaustive `switch` over a
`ProjectDetailTab` union with a `never` default (`CLAUDE.md` Pattern 1). The tab
switcher (`project-tabs.tsx`) is a small `"use client"` island that receives each
**server-rendered panel as a `ReactNode` prop** — panels stay server components.

### 5.1 Overview

- Problem statement + solution summary.
- **Market-demand evidence chips** — 2–3 `MarketInsight`s cross-referenced from the
  knowledge-hub mocks (shows the surfaces interlock).
- "Born from Civic Pulse report" link chip when `originProblemReportId` is set →
  `/problem-map`.
- **Milestone timeline** (`milestone-timeline`) — vertical, done / current / upcoming
  states, with escrow-release amounts per milestone (governance tie-in). Lives here
  rather than a sixth tab to keep the bar tight.

### 5.2 Daily Logs (pillar 6)

Feed of `DailyLogCard`s, date-grouped:

- date, author avatar, **video-thumbnail placeholder** with play glyph,
- transcript excerpt (2 lines, clamped), expandable via native `<details>/<summary>`
  (zero JS),
- **AI summary chips**, kind-colored: `blocker` / `progress` / `velocity` / `suggestion`,
- "Proof of Effort verified" badge,
- member filter chips (client-side filter of the mock array).

> AI analysis and effort verification are **display-only mocks** — the real analysis
> pipeline is backend-later.

### 5.3 Team (pillar 4)

- **Equity split summary bar** — stacked horizontal, one segment per member +
  unallocated.
- Roster cards: name, role, skills, equity %, effort-hours logged, joined date,
  founder marker.
- **Open roles** cards with Express-interest buttons (same interaction as landing 4.6),
  apply via sheet §8.4.

### 5.4 Funding (pillar 5)

- Current round card: type badge (`equity` / `crowdfunding` / `venture`), goal vs
  raised, progress bar, backer count, closes-on date.
- Backer avatar list; past rounds table.
- **Investor confidence meter** — visual-only gauge; annotated in-UI copy: derived from
  log streak + verified milestones. **Display-only mock; backend computes later.**
- **Back this project** → sheet §8.3.

### 5.5 Governance (pillar 7)

- **Escrow ledger table**: date, event description, in/out, amount, linked
  milestone/log, verified/pending status.
- Fund-allocation summary cards: allocated vs released vs held.
- **Per-member compensation table** — "calculated from logged effort" framing
  (anti-corruption story). Mock numbers only.

> Trust note (non-negotiable): every escrow, equity, and compensation figure here is a
> static mock. The platform-as-neutral-auditor logic is entirely server-owned when the
> backend phase starts. The frontend never computes or enforces any of it.

---

## 6. Problem map — `/research-and-development/problem-map` (Civic Pulse)

- Header + **Report a problem** button (opens sheet §8.2).
- **Map canvas** (`problem-map-canvas`, client island): a `relative` container with a
  static world-map image (`next/image`) and `MOCK_PROBLEM_REPORTS` mapped to `<button>`
  pins positioned via `style={{ left: "62%", top: "38%" }}` from
  `mapPosition: { leftPercent, topPercent }` — **no map library**. Pins sized/colored by
  `opportunityScore`. Clicking a pin sets `selectedReportId` and highlights the matching
  card (and vice versa).
- **Report list** (`problem-report-list`) beside/below the canvas — also the
  mobile-first view: title, location, category chip, report count, opportunity score.
- Category filter chips (client-side filter).
- Report sheet appends to a page-local list (lost on refresh — §12 Q5).

✅ **Asset ready**: `public/dummy/world_map.svg` is committed — the map canvas renders
it via `next/image` and overlays the pins.

---

## 7. Knowledge hub — `/research-and-development/knowledge-hub`

- Header framing: "where demand is highest."
- **Insight card grid** — same `MarketInsightCard` as landing 4.5, full set.
- **Demand leaderboard table**: rank, category, region, demand score, trend,
  related-projects count.
- **Rising categories** trend chips row.

All static mock. No chart library — cells use plain numbers + arrow glyphs (▲ ▼ —).
Real charting is a later phase.

---

## 8. Sheets

All four are self-contained `"use client"` components exporting their own trigger
button + bottom sheet (mirrors the store sheets pattern, e.g.
[deliver-to.tsx](src/components/home/store/sections/deliver-to.tsx) → `address-sheet`).

| #   | Sheet                  | Trigger                                  | Fields                                                                              | On submit (mock)                                                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 10. Mock data

Lives in two new files — shared across the landing, `generateStaticParams`, and all
sub-pages, so inline-in-component (the anime pattern) doesn't work here:

- `src/types/research-and-development.ts` — plain TS types (no Zod this phase).
- `src/lib/research-and-development-mocks.ts` — exported `MOCK_*` consts. **No
  fetch, no `"use cache"` getters** — that layer slots in on top when the backend
  phase starts, without moving the mocks.

Money / percentages are **display-formatted strings** (matches
`StoreProduct.price: string` in [src/types/store.ts](src/types/store.ts)); only
values that drive CSS (progress-bar width, pin position) are numbers.

## 12. Decisions for you

1. **Stage taxonomy** — ✅ resolved: the 6-stage taxonomy shipped as specced
   (`market-research`, `problem-validation`, `team-building`, `building-mvp`,
   `raising-funding`, `go-to-market`) — `ProjectStage` in
   `src/types/research-and-development.ts` matches exactly.
2. **Map rendering** — ✅ resolved: static `public/dummy/world_map.svg` (committed) +
   percent-positioned pins. Zero dependencies, matches phase. Real map library stays a
   backend-phase question.
3. **Post-idea** — ✅ resolved: shipped as a sheet (`post-idea-sheet.tsx`), not a
   dedicated route. `/new` wizard stays deferred (§11).
4. **Tabs** — ✅ resolved: client-state only. `project-tabs.tsx` is the 🏝️ client
   island; no `?tab=` / nested-segment addressing was added.
5. **Local-mutation storage** — ⚠️ unresolved — not verified by this pass. Check
   whether sheets/toggles use page-local state or a context provider before relying on
   in-session persistence.
6. **Honest mock interactions** — ⚠️ unresolved — not verified by this pass. Check
   whether "Back this project" moves the progress bar and whether posted ideas append
   to the featured rail.
7. **Relationship to `/studio/pitches` + `/studio/funding`** — ⚠️ unresolved — not
   verified by this pass. Check whether the Funding tab cross-links those surfaces.
8. **Sidebar sub-links** — ✅ resolved: Problem Map (`flag`) + Knowledge Hub (`school`)
   added under the section; double-space typo fixed.
9. **Project Immortal** — ✅ resolved: stayed a standalone `/project-immortal` route
   (mention-only banner links out, not folded into `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS`).
10. **Placeholder imagery** — ⚠️ unresolved — not verified by this pass. Check whether
    reused furniture/anime dummies or new R&D-themed assets were added.
11. **Breadcrumb parent label** — ✅ resolved: `"R&D"` (short form), per
    `navbar.tsx`'s `getSubHeader` branch.

### Components (`src/components/home/research-and-development/`)

All server components unless marked 🏝️ (client island — keep small per `CLAUDE.md`).

✅ **All 32 files below are built.** Two extras beyond this plan also exist:
`sections/request-to-join-button.tsx` (client island pulled out of `project-header.tsx`)
and `sections/daily-logs-feed.tsx` (feed logic split out of `daily-logs-tab.tsx`).

### Build order

1. **Foundations + landing + nav** — types, mocks, landing page with its
   sections/rails/cards, sidebar + navbar edits, thin-shell rewrite of the stub.
   Mocks fix the entity vocabulary; the landing exercises the cards phases 2–3 reuse;
   nav ships with the first visible surface so nothing links to a stub.
2. **Project detail** — `[id]` route + `generateStaticParams`, header, tabs island,
   five tab sections, back-project + apply-role sheets. Deepest page; pure consumer of
   phase 1's `ResearchProject` shape.
3. **Problem map + knowledge hub** — independent of each other and of phase 2; all
   assets already in place (`world_map.svg` committed), so ordering is purely
   scope-driven.

## 14. Placeholder assets needed

Hero + all 6 planned project covers now live in repo, wired in place of their generic
placeholders:

| Purpose                                        | Used by                                                      | File                        | Status                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Pipeline hero background                       | `pipeline-hero.tsx` (§4.1)                                   | `rnd_hero_bg_01.avif`       | ✅ done — replaced `spotlight_image01.avif` |
| Project cover — SolarChill Cold Storage        | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS[0]` (`solar-cold-storage`)           | `rnd_project_cover_01.avif` | ✅ done — replaced `machinery.avif`         |
| Project cover — ClearFlow Modular Purification | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS[1]` (`modular-water-purification`)   | `rnd_project_cover_02.avif` | ✅ done — replaced `category_03.avif`       |
| Project cover — AgriFly Drone Kits             | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS[2]` (`agricultural-drone-kits`)      | `rnd_project_cover_03.avif` | ✅ done — replaced `spotlight_image01.avif` |
| Project cover — Bayanihan Build Panels         | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS[3]` (`prefab-housing-panels`)        | `rnd_project_cover_04.avif` | ✅ done — replaced `pathways_2.avif`        |
| Project cover — Sankofa Circuits Recovery      | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS[4]` (`e-waste-recycling-line`)       | `rnd_project_cover_05.avif` | ✅ done — replaced `category_07.avif`       |
| Project cover — ThermaSure Med Packaging       | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS[5]` (`medical-cold-chain-packaging`) | `rnd_project_cover_06.avif` | ✅ done — replaced `spotlight_image02.avif` |

Resolves §12 Q10: **hero + all 6 project covers now dedicated R&D art.** Remaining
generic placeholders in use elsewhere on the surface — `thumbnail_image*` (daily-log
thumbs), `profile_image_*` (avatars) — verified via grep over
`research-and-development-mocks.ts`. World map (§6) remains the only other
already-dedicated asset.

If/when the rest of the dedicated R&D art is wanted, save under `public/dummy/` using the
`rnd_<purpose>_NN.avif` pattern (zero-padded 2-digit index, matches this doc's asset
naming; keeps R&D art `grep`-able and separate from the store/anime dummy sets):

Problem-map pin category icons are done — 6 SVGs wired into `problem-map-canvas.tsx`,
replacing the plain colored dots:

| Category (mock)                                | Icon | File                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| Water & Sanitation                             | 💧   | `rnd_pin_water.svg`          |
| Precision Agriculture                          | 🌾   | `rnd_pin_agriculture.svg`    |
| Healthcare, Medical Logistics                  | ⚕️   | `rnd_pin_health.svg`         |
| Cold Chain                                     | ⚡   | `rnd_pin_energy.svg`         |
| Housing, E-Waste & Recycling, default fallback | 🏗️   | `rnd_pin_infrastructure.svg` |
| _(reserved, no current category maps to it)_   | 🎓   | `rnd_pin_education.svg`      |

Pin markers keep the opportunity-score signal as a colored ring (red ≥80 / amber ≥60 /
teal below) around the category icon instead of a solid fill color; size still scales
`size-3`/`size-4`/`size-5` by score. Mapping lives in
`PIN_ICON_SRC_BY_CATEGORY` in `problem-map-canvas.tsx` — extend it if new report
categories are added to the mocks.

All 6 SVGs were shipped at a 240×240 fixed canvas with no `viewBox` (couldn't be
resized without clipping) and ~8-decimal path precision (100–250 paths each, 39–178 KB
files) — oversized for a ~12–20px map pin. Fixed in place: added `viewBox="0 0 240 240"`,
shrunk the `width`/`height` attrs to 32, and rounded path/transform coordinates to 2
decimals. Cut 23–33% of file size with no visible difference at pin scale, and the pins
now scale correctly instead of clipping.

Remaining placeholder assets:

| Purpose                                                                                | Used by                                                         | Count | Save as                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Immortal banner (distinct moonshot styling, darker/futuristic)                 | `project-immortal-banner.tsx` (§4.7)                            | 1     | `rnd_immortal_banner_01.avif`                         |
| Daily-log video thumbnails (in-progress build shots — workshop, prototype, whiteboard) | `MOCK_RESEARCH_PROJECTS[].dailyLogs[].videoThumbnailSrc` (§5.2) | 8–12  | `rnd_log_thumb_01.avif` … `rnd_log_thumb_12.avif`     |
| Knowledge-hub trend/insight art (optional — small illustrative accents, not charts)    | `market-insight-card.tsx` (§4.5, §7)                            | 6–8   | `rnd_insight_art_01.avif` … `rnd_insight_art_08.avif` |

Not needed as new assets — existing dummies already cover these adequately:

- **Avatars** — `profile_image_01..12.avif` / `profile_photo_girl.avif` are generic
  enough for `TeamMember.avatarImageSrc`; no R&D-specific portraits required.
- **World map** — `world_map.svg` already committed and R&D-specific.
- **Icons** (`flag`, `school`, `science`, etc.) — already in `/public/icons`, cover
  every nav/section glyph this doc calls for.
