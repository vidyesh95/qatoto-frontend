// Fixtures for the Blueprints hub during the UI-building phase.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS REAL. These are invented builds with invented numbers, and they exist so the
// hub can be designed before there is inventory to fill it. `todo.md` records the standing
// precedent for exactly this state — YouTube did not ship Movies & Shows as a browse skeleton —
// so this file is a decision to be revisited when the first real teardown is published, not a
// staging area that quietly becomes production.
//
// IMPORT SITES NEVER SEE THIS FILE. Everything goes through `@/lib/blueprints/api`, which parses
// each fixture through `BlueprintSchema` before returning it. That is the difference from how
// `@/mocks/anime-mocks` was wired — its components imported the arrays directly, so pointing them
// at a backend meant rewriting the components rather than one getter.
//
// THE SPLIT HERE IS 12 / 10 / 10, NOT 70/20/10, and that is deliberate. The 70/20/10 ratio is a
// content target for REAL builds; applied to fixtures it gave two showcases and two case studies,
// and a launch feed of two rows or a lesson list of two rows does not exercise its own
// design — it reads as broken. The two small buckets are over-sampled so the layouts can be built
// against something that looks like use. There are TEN showcases rather than five because the
// launch feed has a Newest | Top toggle, and a toggle has to show two visibly different orders and
// still page under both — five rows did neither.
//
// ⚠️ THERE ARE TEN CASE STUDIES, TWO PER DISCIPLINE, and the reason changed when the index did. It
// used to be exactly five, one per discipline, because each card carried a discipline TINT and a
// discipline with no fixture was a colour nobody ever saw. The tint is gone — a colour-coded card
// grid was two `docs/Design.md` §6 violations at once — so the count is now set by the list: two
// per discipline is what makes a filtered view show more than one row, and ten against a page
// limit of six is what makes the paging control render at all.
//
// ⚠️ EVERY COMPANY NAME IN THESE ROWS IS INVENTED AND MUST STAY INVENTED. Fabricating a teardown is
// covered by the surface's de-indexing; attaching a fabricated failure to a real company's name is
// not the same thing and is not covered by anything. `sources[]` URLs stay on `example.com` for the
// same reason — a real URL beside an invented figure claims that URL says it.
//
// TWO ROWS HAVE `sources: []`, THREE HAVE `outcomeSummary: null` AND FOUR HAVE `capitalRaised: null`,
// which is not sampling noise. Each is a distinct renderer branch: an empty source list is the one
// absence on this surface that renders COPY rather than nothing, and the other two must render
// nothing at all rather than "Unknown" or a zero.
//
// THE LAUNCH DATES ARE STATIC LITERALS inside the three weeks before 2026-09-08, and they drift
// into the past one day at a time. Accepted: a `new Date()`-relative fixture would bake a
// different order into every `"use cache"` entry, and `RelativeTime` renders whatever the gap is.
// Re-date them when the feed starts to read as abandoned.

/**
 * The one non-USD currency in the fixtures, and it is here to be exercised rather than for flavour.
 *
 * A money field that only ever holds one currency lets a renderer hardcode the symbol and stay
 * green. `capitalRaised` on the Chennai and Coimbatore rows is INR, so `formatCentsLabel` has to
 * take the currency from the row — which is the entire argument for storing integer minor units
 * plus a code instead of the display string "₹1 Cr".
 *
 * ⚠️ THE MINOR UNIT IS THE PAISE, so ₹1 crore is 1_000_000_000. A crore is 10^7 rupees and a rupee
 * is 100 paise; the first draft of this fixture wrote 10^8 and rendered ten lakh, which the build
 * accepted silently because a wrong integer is still an integer.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT GROUPS AS ₹10,000,000 AND NOT ₹1,00,00,000. `formatCentsLabel` is pinned to `en-US`, so
 * every currency in the repo takes Western grouping. That is a house-wide decision in
 * `src/lib/store/format.ts` rather than a bug in this row, and changing it moves every money label

/**
 * EVERY FIXTURE VIDEO IS THE SAME YOUTUBE VIDEO, and there is only one kind of video to be.
 *
 * `eRsGyueVLvQ` is the Blender Foundation's own upload of Sintel, resolved against YouTube's oEmbed
 * endpoint when it was added. Reusing one id across all eight is the same discipline the fixtures
 * kept when they all pointed at one local clip: a made-up id parses fine and then gives a dead
 * player, leaving the whole surface untestable, and eight invented ids would be eight of those.
 *
 * WHY AN INSTITUTION'S UPLOAD AND NOT A TEARDOWN CHANNEL. An individual creator's video breaks the
 * day they delete it; Blender's has been up since 2010, is CC-BY, and is not going to have
 * embedding switched off by someone reorganising a channel. It is a stand-in for a walkthrough, not
 * a claim about the subject — exactly as the Sintel clip was.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DURATION IS THE FILM'S TRUE RUNTIME, READ OFF THE PLAYER, not typed from memory. The badge
 * shows it, and a badge reading "8:12" over a video of another length is a lie the first person to
 * click it discovers. ⚠️ AND IT IS A LUXURY THIS FILE HAS AND A REAL BACKEND DOES NOT: oEmbed
 * reports no duration, so `durationSeconds` is nullable and a real row will usually carry `null`.
 * A fixture that always supplies one would leave the badge-less case unexercised, which is why

/**
 * Twenty-seven builds across the three arms.
 *
 * DELIBERATE ABSENCES, each one there so its branch renders during development rather than the
 * first time real data arrives:
 *
 * - `billOfMaterialsCostRange: null` on `thermal-camera-module-teardown` and
 *   `nairobi-injection-molding-case-study` — an uncosted build is an ordinary state, and the
 *   renderer must show an absence rather than a $0 band.
 * - `walkthroughVideo: null` AND `documents: []` together on `thermal-camera-module-teardown` and
 *   `low-cost-spectrometer-optical-path` — a teardown that published nothing. The media sections
 *   must be ABSENT, not empty boxes.
 * - `builtFromBlueprintSlug: null` on `dairy-chiller-retrofit-pilot` — a launch built from
 *   something that was never published here.
 * - `cadFormat: null` on `dairy-chiller-retrofit-pilot` and `off-grid-mesh-nodes-kumasi-market` —
 *   a build with no published CAD, so the spec list must omit the row rather than print "—".
 * - `upvoteCount: 96` on BOTH `hand-pump-gearbox-replacement-kit` and
 *   `grain-moisture-meter-field-units` — a deliberate tie, so the `top` comparator's tie-break is
 *   exercised on the second page of `?sort=top` rather than only described in a comment.
 * - `callToAction: null` and `demoVideo: null` on several showcases — most launches have neither.
 * - `partCount: null` where nobody counted. Not zero: a zero-part teardown is not a teardown.
 * - `assembly: null` on ten of the twelve teardowns — most published no model, and the exploded
 *   view must be ABSENT rather than an empty viewport. The two that carry one take DIFFERENT
 *   modes: `solar-cold-storage-controller-teardown` is ONE composite `.glb` addressed by node
 *   name; `borehole-pump-housing-tolerances` is SIX per-part files, the shape an upload takes,
 *   with one part (`seal_carrier`) exported at its own origin so the explicit `placement` branch
 *   renders too.
 * - `fasteners: []`, `manufacturingFiles: []`, `assemblySteps: []` and `repairabilityIndex: null`
 *   TOGETHER on `borehole-pump-housing-tolerances`, which does carry a model and telemetry — a
 *   teardown with a viewport and nothing else, so every other section proves it can be absent on
 *   its own. ⚠️ DO NOT ATTACH FILES TO THIS ROW to exercise something; it is the only one holding
 *   that combination, and the mechanical file set went to `hand-pump-gearbox-teardown` for exactly
 *   this reason.
 * - `manufacturingFiles` ON THREE OF TWELVE, in three different mixes, because the index card now
 *   NAMES the formats rather than counting files. `solar-cold-storage-controller-teardown` has all
 *   six kinds, which is the only row that overflows the card's four-name cap and renders its "+2";
 *   `brushless-motor-driver-schematic` has four ELECTRONICS kinds and `hand-pump-gearbox-teardown`
 *   three MECHANICAL ones, so `ManufacturingFileBundles` renders a single-bundle page both ways
 *   round. One row out of twelve would have left all three branches unexercised on eleven cards.
 * - `simulationTelemetry` on exactly the two modelled teardowns, at factors of safety 3.1 and 1.6,
 *   so both the safe and the marginal colour bands render somewhere.
 * - `calloutText: null` on one MOSFET, so a part with no pin sits beside parts with pins.
 */
/**
 * LIVE STORE LISTINGS OF THE SAME PRODUCT CLASS, keyed by `storeProductClass.categorySlug`.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE PRIMARY MARKET SIGNAL AND IT IS THE ONE THAT IS MOCK ON PURPOSE RATHER THAN BY
 * DEFAULT. `searchStore({ categorySlug })` (`src/lib/store/catalog.api.ts`) is a live, wired read,
 * and `TeardownStoreListingSignalSchema` is a field-for-field subset of `StoreSearchHitSchema` so
 * that pointing at it is a `.map`. It stays here because every teardown in this file is INVENTED —
 * the class each one names is invented too, and joining real listings onto a product that does not
 * exist would present real commerce as evidence about a fabrication. Swap it when the teardowns are
 * real, in `api.ts`, and nothing above changes.
 *
 * A CLASS WITH NO ENTRY IS AN ABSENT HALF, NOT AN EMPTY LIST TO RENDER.
 * `battery-management-modules` is deliberately missing so one teardown's signal comes from its
 * showcase alone, and `dairy-cooling` has no showcase so one comes from listings alone. A third
 * teardown has neither and suppresses the whole block.
 *
 * `priceInCents` AND `currency` TRAVEL TOGETHER. The last row here has neither, which is what a

      "We put the controller from the teardown into a 400 L chest unit and left it in Nakuru market for ninety days. The trader who runs the stall kept it loaded the whole time, which is the only version of this test worth reporting: an empty cabinet coasting on its own insulation holds a number nobody can use.\n\n" +
      "The headline is 62 hours at 4 °C with no sun, measured with 380 L of produce loaded at 6 °C and an ambient that peaked at 41 °C. Empty, the same cabinet runs past 90 hours. We stopped quoting that figure after the first week because it flatters the design and tells a buyer nothing.\n\n" +
      "Two things failed. A compressor start relay went at week three: it was rated for the current and not for forty starts a day, and nothing in its datasheet distinguishes the two. A door gasket took a permanent set in the heat and stopped sealing at the top corner, which cost about four hours of hold time before anyone noticed it.\n\n" +
      "The battery is lead-acid, and that is the decision people argue with most. LiFePO4 would give better cycle life and would not derate at 41 °C. It would also mean a trader whose pack dies has a unit out of service until something ships, where a lead-acid battery is a same-afternoon walk to a shop they already use. A pack nobody local can source is a cold store that dies the first time it needs one.\n\n" +
      "Next is the gasket, in a material that does not take a set, and a start relay chosen on cycles rather than amps. Neither moves the bill of materials by more than a few dollars.",

 *   5. A tombstone with a live reply `bpc-003` / `bpc-004`
 *   6. A body containing a bare URL  `bpc-005`
 *   7. An empty thread               the seven launches absent from this map
 *   8. A thread on a null write-up   `brushless-cargo-trike-drivetrain`, whose `writeUp` is `null`
 *
 * ⚠️ STATE 8 IS A PAIR ACROSS TWO FILES AND BREAKS SILENTLY. `brushless-cargo-trike-drivetrain`
 * carries `writeUp: null` in `MOCK_BLUEPRINTS` above AND a thread here, which is the combination
 * that proves a discussion renders on a launch nobody wrote up. Giving that launch a write-up would
 * cost nothing visible and would quietly retire the state.
 *
 * ⚠️ STATE 5 DEPENDS ON THE TOMBSTONE STAYING A ROW. `listShowcaseComments` DROPS a reply whose
 * parent is missing from this array, so deleting `bpc-003` rather than nulling it would take
 * `bpc-004` off the page too. That is the whole argument for tombstoning instead of deleting,
 * rendered rather than asserted: `body` and `author` are both `null`, and the row survives.
 *
 * ⚠️ STATE 4 IS AN @MENTION AND NOT A SECOND LEVEL OF NESTING. `bpc-014` answers `bpc-013`, which is
 * itself a reply, and it does so as a reply to their shared PARENT with the handle naming who it
 * addresses. That is the shape a one-level backend forces and the shape the eventual composer will
 * write. `brushless-cargo-trike-drivetrain` also keeps THREE REPLIES ON ONE PARENT with none on each
 * other, which is that limit rendered rather than asserted, so do not flatten it into three parents.
 *
 * ⚠️ `commentCount` ON EACH SHOWCASE MUST EQUAL THE LENGTH OF ITS THREAD HERE, and the tombstone
 * COUNTS because the row exists. The count renders in the engagement bar beside the thread it
 * counts, and a disagreement between the two is the one lie this surface would be telling on a page
 * that otherwise refuses to invent numbers. There is no test enforcing it: the count is a wire field
 * a real backend computes, so deriving it from this map would model the wrong thing.
 *
 * EVERY `createdAt` POSTDATES ITS SHOWCASE'S `launchedAt`, and they drift into the past with the
 * launch dates for the reason the file header records. `listShowcaseComments` orders PARENTS
 * newest-first, so the reading order on screen is not this array's order.
