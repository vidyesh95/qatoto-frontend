/**
 * How deeply a write-up nests block containers — quotes, lists and footnote definitions.
 *
 * ⚠️ A DELIBERATE COPY of the backend's
 * `qatoto-backend/src/modules/home/blueprints/showcase-write-up-nesting.ts`.
 * Everything below this comment is identical in both files, down to the constant; only the
 * pointer above differs. There is no package shared between the two repositories, so they are
 * kept in step by hand and diffed when either changes — a test on each side pins the constant,
 * so the two cannot drift silently.
 *
 * WHY A WRITE-UP NEEDS A SECOND SHAPE RULE, when it already has a character cap and a markup cap.
 * Nesting is where a markdown parser meets a call stack, and the character cap does not bound it —
 * one marker character buys one level. Measured on this machine, all UNDER the 10,000-character
 * cap and all accepted before this rule existed:
 *
 *   `"- ".repeat(4900)`    7,073 ms of synchronous parse on the server
 *   `"-\t".repeat(4900)`  10,273 ms
 *   `"1. ".repeat(3300)`     458 ms
 *
 * Ten seconds is single-threaded and blocks every other request in flight. The markup cap does not
 * catch any of them: it counts `*`, `_`, `[` and `]`, and the expensive markers here are `-`, `+`
 * and the ordered ones.
 *
 * AND THE READER'S BROWSER, which is the half this server cannot see. The frontend renders a
 * write-up with `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`, which still runs the recursive tree transform
 * `showcase-launch-markdown.ts` strips here. Against the frontend's own installed copies,
 * `">".repeat(6000)`, `"- ".repeat(4900)`, `"+ ".repeat(3200)` and `"1. ".repeat(3333)` all throw
 * `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` — so a launch this server stored happily would
 * blank the page of every reader and moderator who opened it. A row that cannot be rendered is
 * worse than one that was never posted, which is why this refuses rather than truncates.
 *
 * THE OPENER ALPHABET IS CLOSED, and that is what makes this scanner complete rather than a list of
 * shapes that happened to be tried. micromark's `document` construct table is exactly `42 (*)`,
 * `43 (+)`, `45 (-)`, `48-57 (digits)` and `62 (>)`; `micromark-extension-gfm` adds exactly one
 * more, `91 ([`, from its footnote extension. Nothing else can open a block container, so nothing
 * else can add a level. `showcase-write-up-nesting.test.ts` pins both of those key sets, so a
 * dependency upgrade that adds a container fails the gate rather than opening a silent bypass.

/**
 * The deepest a write-up may nest block containers.
 *
 * WHY 32, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE RAISED BY EYE. Real content scores 0 to 4 — a four-deep quote is an
 * email chain someone pasted, and a list holding a sub-list holding a quote still scores 1. The
 * renderer's ceiling is roughly 2,600 levels, measured on a full render rather than a parse, which
 * is about half what parsing alone survives; a browser's stack is tighter still than Node's.
 *
 * The number is not the depth, though. Indentation alone also nests, without any marker for this
 * scanner to count, and it costs about d² characters to reach depth d — so the character cap bounds
 * that route at about 98 levels on its own. The relation to keep in mind is:
 *
 *   reachable depth ≈ this cap + sqrt(2 × the character cap)
 *
 * At 32 that is roughly 262, about ten times under the renderer's ceiling. At 1,000 — which sounds
 * conservative — it would be roughly 2,100, inside the band where the renderer dies.

 * The deepest run of block-container openers on any one line.

 * A LINEAR SCAN, NOT A PARSE, because the thing it protects is the parse. It deliberately
 * over-counts in two harmless places — `- - -` is a thematic break rather than three lists, and
 * `[ref]: https://…` is a link definition rather than a container — and neither goes anywhere near
 * the cap. Over-counting refuses a document that would have been fine; under-counting ships the
 * bypass, so the scanner leans the first way on purpose.
