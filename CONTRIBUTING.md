## Code Style

### Formatting with Oxc

To maintain a consistent codebase, we use `oxfmt` for formatting. **You must format your code before submitting a Pull Request.**

We have provided a script to make this easy:

```bash
pnpm run format
```

This will run `oxfmt` on the entire project and apply any necessary changes.

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and file names (unless they correspond to a class).
- Use kebab-case for directory names.
