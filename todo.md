# TODO

**Open work only.** Everything that shipped is deleted from this file — the code, the backend docs
and `git log` are the record of what was built and why.

> **Pruned 2026-08-27, from 1,531 lines.** The rule above had stopped being true: roughly 1,100
> lines were retrospectives on shipped work, and three of them (§8 SEO, §17 provider filters, §2's
> mock-file count) had gone far enough out of date to actively mislead — they described work that
> had since shipped. Nothing was deleted until its reasoning was confirmed to exist in a code
> comment or a backend doc; the one thing that lived ONLY here — the hand-written migration
> workflow — moved to `qatoto-backend/docs/AUTH_SETUP.md` §6 first, which also had to stop telling
> readers to run `pnpm db:generate`.
>
> **Section numbers are NOT reindexed.** They are anchors: several sections cite `§19.10`/`§19.11`
> in the backend contract, and renumbering would silently point those at the wrong thing. Gaps in

## At a glance

**Blocked on a purchase, not on code** — §11 (SMS provider), §18 (freight rate cards).

**The one substantial build left** — §5, cost of goods and therefore margin.

**Everything else** is either content-blocked (`/anime`), a new backend domain nobody has asked
for yet (§15, §16, five of the eight planned Studio routes), or a question for Vidyesh rather than
a task (**Decisions needed**).

---

## Blocked

### 11. `phone_number` column — BLOCKED ON A VENDOR, not on code

`session.user.phoneNumber` and `phoneNumberVerified` are declared client-side in
`src/lib/auth-client.ts` via `inferAdditionalFields`, and the backend has no `phoneNumber()` plugin
and no column — `rg phoneNumber qatoto-backend/src` returns nothing.

⚠️ **THIS WAS A LIVE BREAK UNTIL 2026-08-27 AND IS NOW INERT.** The panel shipped a working-looking
two-step OTP flow driving `authClient.phoneNumber.sendOtp()`, which type-checked and put a request
on the wire: `POST /api/auth/phone-number/send-otp` answers **404**. Anyone who opened Settings →
Phone number and pressed "Send code" got an error for a feature nothing implemented. The panel now
renders read-only and says phone verification is not available yet — the `/customer-service` shape,
on its stated ground that an unanswered form is worse than an honest signpost.

**It is a purchase before it is a migration.** Better Auth's `phoneNumber()` plugin requires a
`sendOTP` implementation and there is no SMS provider in `src/config/index.ts` or `.env.example` —
the only OTP delivery configured is Brevo, which is email. Writing the plugin first would leave a
route minting codes nobody receives, the same failure one layer down. `git log` has the removed
flow; nothing about it was wrong except that nothing answered it.

### 18. Freight rate data

`delivery-sheet.tsx` works. The routes, tables and rating service all exist, and the rate tables
ship **empty by design** (A36). Every lane answers `no_active_rate_card` and `shippingInCents` is
permanently `0` until a forwarder lane list is purchased. Nothing to build — this is a buying
decision, and [the uncovered-inland-leg rule](#decisions-needed) should be settled before the money
is spent.

## Seller cost-of-goods and margin — DECIDED: NOT BUILDING IT

⚠️ **THIS WAS THIS FILE'S HEADLINE ITEM AND IS NOW CLOSED. Do not reopen it as an oversight.**
`seller-earnings-panel.tsx` says profit and margin are not shown because Qatoto never records what a
seller paid. That copy is correct and stays. Three reasons, in order of weight:

1. **This codebase forbids the operation, in its own words, three times.**
   `commerce-earnings.service.ts`: _"A client is free to render them together. It is not free to add
   them."_ · `commissionOwed` _"sits in its own member and is never netted off"_ · _"there is
   deliberately no grand total in this response, and adding one later would be a regression rather
   than a feature."_ Margin is the most combined number available — a SELF-REPORTED cost subtracted
   from PLATFORM-MEASURED revenue, across the exact A13 boundary
   `commerce_journal_account_memorandum_ck` exists to hold. The same three sentences also rule out
   the tempting middle path of a "net after platform deductions" figure: netting refunds is refused
   because it _"would make a fully refunded order indistinguishable from one that never happened"_.
2. **Alibaba and AliExpress both omit it; only Amazon has it.** Amazon sellers need a COGS input
   because Amazon's own fee soup obscures take-home — Qatoto already shows `commissionOwed` as its
   own line running the other way, so the platform-knowable half of that gap is already closed here.
3. **Nobody would fill it in.** Per-order-line manual entry, no purchase record, no import, no ERP
   hook. A margin computed over 12 of 47 orders is worse than no margin, which is what the panel
   already says.

**If this is ever revisited**, the constraint to design around first is that the cost cannot live on
`commerce_order_product_line` — that row is an immutable commercial snapshot and a seller-entered
cost is correctable.

---

## Frontend

### 2. The video domain — two `TRANSPORT: mock` banners remain

`rg -l "TRANSPORT: mock" src/` returns **two** files:

- `src/components/home/watch/comments.tsx` — `trending` only
- `src/components/home/watch/watch-content.tsx` — `transcript` and `isPremium` only

**Neither imports a fixture.** Each holds an inline EMPTY placeholder — `[]`, `undefined`, `false`
— so a real component shell survives with its layout intact, and each banner names a backend gap
rather than an unfinished screen. Deleting a placeholder is a one-line change AFTER its field ships.

**Each needs a new backend capability — a table, a job or a model, not just a route:** transcript
(no ASR pipeline, no transcript table, no column on `video`); `isPremium` (no entitlement model, no
tier, no paywall anywhere); trending search terms (no aggregation). Download is structurally
impossible — the bytes are on youtube.com.

### 9. Never exercised

- **`standardName`** — the seed creates 7 uncoded and 0 coded factory certifications, so the field
  added for it has never met a live payload.
- **The delivery-address 429** — the seeded checkout sends no `deliveryAddressId`, so the reveal
  404s before the limiter is in play.
- **The browser.** Every store contract above was asserted over HTTP. No screen has been watched
  rendering.

### Share targets have no brand marks

`public/icons` has `mail` and nothing else, so three of the four `video_share_channel` targets — X,
WhatsApp, LinkedIn — render the generic `share` glyph and are told apart by their labels. Hand-
writing trademarked logo paths from memory was the worse option. Drop real assets in.

### The feed's negative signal has two known limits

- **A topic penalty only lands where a snapshot row already exists**, because the job's `FROM` is
  `video_view_session` — a category dismissed but never watched gets no damping. Widening it means
  writing rows whose only evidence is negative, and since the ranker's `max(COALESCE(...))` treats a
  stored 0 as _stronger_ suppression than an absent row, that is a real ranking change rather than a
  one-line fix.
- **Un-muting takes up to one nightly cycle to stop damping.** The hard filter lifts instantly.

## Backend (`qatoto-backend`)

### 15. Multi-axis variants

`commerce_product_variant_option{variantId, optionName, optionValue, position}`. A26 defers it
deliberately — building axes early migrates every row that reaches an immutable order-line
snapshot, for a UI nothing has asked for yet.

### 16. Incoterm semantics

Phase 23 shipped the vocabulary only; nothing branches on the value. Needed for port-to-port
pricing on an uncovered inland leg. Note the casing: `commerce_incoterm` is UPPERCASE, unlike every
other enum on the wire.

### Procurement — all three SHIPPED

- ~~**Documents on a quote.**~~ **Both sides now.** `commerce_quote_revision_document` (`0146`) plus
  `documentIds` on the revision-append body, and an attachment step in BOTH composers. The entry
  said "there is no route to attach one" — **that was stale**: `POST /commerce/documents` had
  shipped with encryption, virus scanning and audit entries, and the RFQ composer carried the same
  stale "backend gap" banner. Fourth entry this session costed before its rail existed.
    - **⚠️ KEYED ON THE REVISION, NOT THE QUOTE.** A revision is the immutable offer, so keying on the
      quote would let a provider swap the spec sheet behind an offer a buyer had already read.
      **Proved in a rolled-back transaction**: a document on revision A is invisible on revision B,
      and a duplicate attach is a `23505`.
    - **⚠️ AN UPLOAD IS NOT AN ATTACHMENT.** That route answers **202** — `pending_scan` until an async
      virus scan clears it — and every attach path refuses anything not `available`. The picker lists
      only scanned documents, so what it offers is what the save accepts. Verified: owner + available
      → attachable; another organization → refused; still scanning → refused.
- ~~**`/studio/quotes` status filter.**~~ **SHIPPED**, server-side. The read and the wrapper always
  passed `?status=`; nothing set it. Filtering the fetched page would have short-paged a keyset list
  and made "no submitted quotes" indistinguishable from "none on this page".
- ~~**`/studio/reviews` paging.**~~ **SHIPPED, forward-only.** The cursor is SORT-SCOPED — its sort
  key is inside the cursor, so carrying one across a sort change is a **422**, not a reset — so
  `cursor` is cleared by every filter and sort change. Forward-only is the keyset's shape: there is
  no "previous" token without stacking them, and a page-number control needs a COUNT this route does
  not return. "Start over" is the honest way back.

### Moderation gaps recorded by decision, not oversight

- **`talent_profile.bio` is the one other public self-description with no moderation lever.** A
  person whose channel bio is hidden can put the same text there. Out of scope by decision —
  recorded so the next reader knows which.
- **One entry point for reporting a profile** — Channel → About → Report. Video reporting sits on
  every card menu.

## Documentation drift

Each of these misleads a reader; none changes behaviour.

1. **Sections written in future tense about shipped work**: `HOME_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` §8.3,
   `STUDIO_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` §9, §13 and §5.1. **§13 is the urgent one** — its verification
   recipe tells a reader to expect behaviour that no longer happens, so following it looks like
   finding a bug.
2. **The four `/users/*/reports` moderation routes are still undocumented** —
   `user-reports.routes.ts` carries `reportUser`, `listUserReports`, `decideUserReport` and
   `restoreUserProfileText`, and no doc table has a row for any of them. They want a table modelled
   on `HOME_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` §5.2c's. (The rest of that backlog closed: the six missing route
   and job rows, the channel-profile pair and both self-read report routes all have rows now.)
3. **The frontend repo carries stale FORKS of four backend docs.** Copies, not links, and they have
   drifted. Decide whether to re-sync them or delete them and point at the backend repo — a fork
   nobody updates is worse than no copy.

---

## Still open, in the order worth taking them

1. **`/anime` end to end — the last fabricated surface on the site.** Five pages read
   `@/mocks/anime-mocks` and the routes are excluded from `sitemap.ts` for exactly that reason. The
   backend has the tables — `anime_series` / `anime_season` / `anime_episode`, with `genreTags`,
   `status` (ongoing/completed/hiatus), `releaseScheduleDay`/`Time` and `premiereDate` — plus
   `trendingVideoSnapshot` (hourly, ranked) for the ranking page. What does not exist is any PUBLIC
   catalogue read: all eleven `/series` routes are `requireAuth` and owner-scoped, and the feed has
   no `videoType` facet, so anime episodes are indistinguishable in it. This is one new public
   backend module plus five page rewires. Two notes for whoever takes it: **`/anime/favorite` is
   nearly free** — it is Liked and Bookmarked, which `GET /users/me/liked-videos` and
   `/saved-videos` already serve, needing only a `videoType` filter — and **`/anime/genre`'s chips
   and `/anime/ranking`'s sort currently change nothing**, they re-render the same mock array, so
   wiring them is a behaviour change rather than a data swap.

    **⚠️ THE BLOCKER IS CONTENT, NOT CODE — and that reorders this whole list.** Probed against the
    live database on 2026-08-27: `anime_series` **0 rows**, `anime_season` **0**, `anime_episode`
    **0**, and `video WHERE video_type = 'anime_episode'` **0**. Wiring the five pages today would
    replace five pages of invented content with five blank ones. **YouTube's own decision is the
    precedent: it does not ship a vertical it cannot fill** — Movies & Shows launched with licensed
    inventory, not a browse skeleton. Leaving `/anime` on mocks is therefore a decision, recorded
    here, and it is revisited when the first series is seeded rather than on a schedule.

    **IT IS ALSO CHEAPER THAN THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE BILLS IT.** No migration — every column exists. The
    projection discipline is already written: `src/modules/studio/series/public-series.service.ts` is
    "the ONLY public read of an anime series anywhere on the platform" and already states why the
    studio's own eleven `/series` routes must stay owner-scoped (they return unreleased episode
    titles, premiere dates and the production schedule). And `/anime/watch` is already the real watch
    page, not a mock.

    **TWO DECISIONS BLOCK IT, and only one was known.** (a) `genreTags` is a free-text array, so a
    genre chip row needs a canonical list. (b) **`/anime/ranking`'s period selector cannot be served
    by `trending_video_snapshot`** — its columns are `as_of`, `rank`, `trending_score_points`,
    `counted_views_in_window` and the component points, with **no period dimension at all**. It is a
    rolling HOURLY top-200. "This week" and "this month" are not filters over it; they are a second
    snapshot cadence, or they are not offered.

2. **The eight `planned` Studio routes that are left.** ⚠️ **DO NOT INHERIT A COST FROM THIS LINE
   WITHOUT CHECKING IT** — the version above it was wrong about `funding` for months. **Five
   genuinely need a new domain**: `subtitles` (no caption table; `captionCertification` is a text
   column on `video`), `copyright` (a video-REPORT-REASON enum member, not a claims table),
   `pitches` (`pitch` is a `video_type` enum member, not a table), `team` (account-level
   collaborators; the `video_collaborator` table is per-video and already wired) and `earn` (a money
   rail — escrow left this codebase, §7). The other three — `learn`, `support`, `feedback` — are the
   `/customer-service` shape and have not been costed since that page shipped as authored content.

---

## Cross-pillar seams

R&D, Store and Studio keep separate copies of the same venture. The four moves that shipped
(`product.researchProjectId`, `video.researchProjectId`, the venture reel and badge, the apply-from-
watch link) are in the code. What follows is the part that must not be re-derived wrong.

### What was dropped, and why

**`dailyLog.videoId → studio.video` — dropped. It would break the equity chain.** Both sides
state their delete semantics and they are opposites:

```text
studio.ts:190-198   creatorId → user.id, onDelete: CASCADE
                    "a video bears no ledger, equity or audit weight, so it is a
                     possession that dies with the account rather than a record
                     that must outlive it"

rnd.ts:3095-3100    authorMemberId → projectMember.id, onDelete: RESTRICT
                    "this row is effort evidence and its author must stay
                     resolvable forever"
```

`dailyLog` → `effortClaim` (unique, one claim per log, `rnd.ts:3966`) → `sliceLedgerEntry`. It is
the input to the entire equity ledger. Putting it behind a row that cascade-dies with a user
account puts equity evidence behind a possession — and a `restrict` on `dailyLog.videoId` does
not fix it, it inverts it: the user→video cascade then fails and account deletion throws, which the
privacy surface (`anonymize-account.service.ts`, behind two default-off flags) depends on.

**`video.visibility: "team"` — dropped with it.** Not one enum value. `isSourceVerified` has three
documented readers (`publishVideo`, content-review approve, feed candidate pool —
`studio.ts:204-230`) and `video_gating_ck` (`studio.ts:432`) already refuses `investor_only` for
youtube rows. A fourth visibility state needs all of them to agree, plus content review, plus
feed exclusion.

**`videoMilestone.milestoneId → rnd.milestone` — dropped.** `milestone` carries
`plannedPayoutInCents` (`rnd.ts:6047`) and `escrowRelease` holds a notNull `milestoneId` with
double-payout unique indexes (`rnd.ts:6157`, `:6183`). Pointing a watch-page roadmap label at
that row makes a video label imply money. `studio.ts:50-57` is an explicit, itemised refusal of
exactly this — read it before reopening the question.

**`videoTeamMember.memberId → projectMember` — dropped as unnecessary.** `videoTeamMember` already
has `linkedUserId` (nullable, `set null`, `studio.ts:587-604`) and the frontend renders nothing
from it. Use the column that exists.

**Feeding store sales and reviews into `demandSignalSnapshot`** SHIPPED, but only as recorded
evidence — see the section above. The prediction here was half right: the numbers are all zero
today because no product carries a `researchProjectId` yet, so the join finds nothing. What was
wrong is the assumption that it needed items 19–21 first; the plumbing was buildable now, and
the counts will start moving on their own the moment a venture ships a listing that sells.

---

## Decisions needed

Each of these is a question for Vidyesh, not a task.

- **The legal entity.** `LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME`, `LEGAL_ENTITY_REGISTERED_ADDRESS`,
  `GOVERNING_LAW_JURISDICTION` and `GOVERNING_LAW_COURTS` in `src/lib/site.ts` all render as
  bracketed "TO BE CONFIRMED" text in the live privacy policy and terms. **Fill all four in one
  edit; nothing else changes.**
- **Does anyone read `support@qatoto.com`?** The privacy policy commits to answering data-subject
  requests within one month (Art. 12(3)) and every control in the app is a `mailto:` to it.
- **Three more addresses are hardcoded and unverified** — `security@qatoto.com` in
  `disclaimers/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.tsx` (×2), `careers@qatoto.com` in
  `information/careers.tsx` (×4), `press@qatoto.com` in `information/press.tsx` and
  `press-detail.tsx`. None goes through `lib/site.ts`. A vulnerability disclosure policy naming an
  unread inbox is the worst of the three.
- **What does Qatoto contract to do?** Both legal documents still describe a video sharing site —
  the terms call themselves "the Qatoto Video Sharing Site" — and neither mentions the store, R&D,
  orders, payments, equity or projects, which are the parts that create obligations between people.
  Rewriting them changes what they CLAIM, so the answer has to come first.
- **A consent banner becomes mandatory the moment any analytics, advertising or embedded
  third-party script ships.** Cookies are essential-only today and the policy says so in as many
  words; that sentence becomes false with the first script, and the banner is part of that change
  rather than a follow-up to it.
- **§14: cofounder capital range / equity ask.** Publishing what a person will invest beside a
  contact affordance is close to a securities solicitation, and how close is a per-market answer.
  The columns deliberately do not exist and `verify-store-phase-19-constraints` asserts their
  absence by name.
- **§14: "online revenue" on a public seller profile.** Publishable only on explicit consent —
  needs a consent column, a withdrawal path and a third wire member. **Not the same thing as the
  `/sales` earnings panel**, which is self-scoped and authenticated; a seller reading their own
  books needs no consent.
- **The uncovered-inland-leg rule.** Until it is settled, most real lanes show nothing _even after_
  rate data is bought. Worth deciding before spending on cards.
- **Below-smallest-band yields no option.** One reviewable row per card at
  `minBillableWeightGrams: 0` closes it — a data decision, documented as §19.11 step 4.
- **Should `POST /commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards` refuse a silent supersede?** §19.10's list
  route exists now, so an operator can see the incumbent and `supersedesRateCardId` becomes
  expressible.
- **Naming the reporter in the moderation queue.** `CommunityContentReportProjection` carries no
  reporter identity and the queue shows none. A moderator who can see who reported whom is a
  moderator who can be lobbied — worth deciding deliberately rather than by adding a schema field.
- **The Postgres ceiling.** `max_connections = 20` on the free-tier Aiven instance, and API +
  worker + a seed script is most of it. Either the per-process pool comes down or the plan goes up
  before anyone trusts a local run.

---

## Never verified in a browser

Every contract in this file was asserted over HTTP or in served HTML. Two surfaces in particular
have never been watched rendering: the authenticated channel-profile paths (saving a bio, filing a
report, upholding one) and **`/studio/funding`**, which is a client-query page whose data never
reaches a curl. A browser check is the one gap no amount of route testing closes.

---

## Verification

The gate. Run all five — `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` alone is the one command of the four that misses
a whole class of error that `next build` and oxlint both catch:

```bash
pnpm fmt && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit && pnpm lint && pnpm fmt:check && pnpm build
```

The backend needs **both** processes. Without the worker, payments accept and never settle, with an
EMPTY `last_error`:

```bash
cd ../../backend/qatoto-backend
pnpm dev          # the API
pnpm dev:worker   # pg-boss — DISPATCHES THE PAYMENT OUTBOX
pnpm db:seed-store-demo   # store-demo-{buyer,seller,staff}@example.invalid / store-demo-password-2026
```

A green `/health` proves nothing — it touches no database.

The uncalled-wrapper audits. Note `--no-filename`, without which every name is prefixed by its path
and the loop reports everything as uncalled — **and note the widened glob**, because the version
that only globbed `src/lib/store/*.api.ts` is why the seven R&D wrappers went unnoticed for so
long:

```bash
for h in $(rg --no-filename -o 'export function (use\w+)' -r '$1' src/hooks/ | sort -u); do
  rg -q "\b$h\b" src/components src/app || echo "UNCALLED $h"; done

for f in $(rg --no-filename -o 'export (?:async )?function (\w+)' -r '$1' \
    $(find src/lib -name '*.api.ts') | sort -u); do
  rg -q "\b$f\b" src/hooks src/components src/app || echo "UNCALLED-API $f"; done
```

**THE GLOB IS NOW `find`, NOT FOUR HAND-LISTED DIRECTORIES**, and that is the third time this has
bitten. It started as `src/lib/store/*.api.ts` alone, which is why seven R&D wrappers went unnoticed;
it was widened to four directories, and `src/lib/users/*.api.ts` then shipped outside all four — so
the audit that is supposed to catch unverified code was not looking at the newest code in the repo.
A hand-maintained list of places to check is a list that will be wrong again.

**Both are silent today.** The second printed seven R&D names until those wrappers were wired
(`listRoundBackers`, `listEquitySnapshots`, `verifyStatementChain`, `getAuditHashInput`,
`updateWorkshopChatMessage`, `deleteWorkshopChatMessage`) or deleted as a duplicate
(`getProjectEquity`). A name reappearing here is unverified code, not a style nit.

Note the banner check uses `--files-without-match`; `rg -L` is `--follow` and silently reports
the opposite of what it looks like it reports:

```bash
rg --files-without-match 'TRANSPORT:' src/components/home/research-and-development --glob '*.tsx'
```
