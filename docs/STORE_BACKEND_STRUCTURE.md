# STORE_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md — B2B Store, Procurement, and Trade Services

> This document specifies the **buyer-facing store and commerce backend** for Qatoto:
> public catalog discovery, company storefronts, requests for quotation, quote negotiation,
> purchase orders, payment orchestration, fulfillment, and independently selectable trade-service
> providers.
>
> The backend repository is `/Users/vinitchuri/code/backend/qatoto-backend`.
>
> **Read alongside:**
>
> - [STORE_STRUCTURE.md](STORE_STRUCTURE.md) — the frontend route, component, and integration plan.
> - [STUDIO_PRODUCTS_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md](STUDIO_PRODUCTS_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md) — the shipped
>   seller-owned `/products/*` CRUD, images, B2B tiers, publish, and unpublish contract.
> - [STUDIO_PRODUCTS_STRUCTURE.md](STUDIO_PRODUCTS_STRUCTURE.md) — the shipped seller listing UI.
> - [R_AND_D_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md](R_AND_D_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md) — the separate R&D supplier
>   directory and project-engagement domain.
> - [ESCROW_LEDGER_STRUCTURE.md](ESCROW_LEDGER_STRUCTURE.md) — the existing project-funding ledger;
>   commerce may reuse its accounting patterns, not its project-scoped rows.
> - [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — thin-client trust boundary and wire-casing rules.
>
> **Goal:** provide an Alibaba-style B2B market where an organization can discover and buy a
> product, request negotiated pricing, and separately engage freight forwarders, air/sea/land
> logistics operators, customs brokers, insurance providers, inspection agencies, testing and
> certification laboratories, marketing agencies, warehouse providers, and foreign-exchange
> facilitators.
>
> **Stack:** Express 5 + TypeScript strict + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL + Zod + Better Auth +
> Cloudinary/object storage + pg-boss + the existing provider-adapter and rate-limit patterns.
>
> **Status:** **Phases 0–19 shipped and hardened.** Seller `/products/*` CRUD, commerce
> organizations/memberships/addresses/verification, public `/store/*` catalog reads,
> merchandising, search documents, the provider connector directory, RFQs, quote negotiation,
> quote-originated order snapshots, RFQ/quote threads, buyer carts, server-priced checkout
> preparation and confirmation into direct-checkout orders, buyer/counterparty order queues and
> cancellation, product shipments, standalone service engagements, commerce payment intents,
> refunds, a double-entry commerce journal (fake provider adapter only), shipment-leg command
> execution, immutable typed engagement snapshots, contracted deliverable plans/results,
> derived fulfillment progress, server-issued completions, verified reviews, disputes, and
> privacy-safe review/completion metrics are implemented. Phase 8 adds **product variants,
> media kinds, specification groups, packaging geometry, product highlights, the product
> relation graph, and the merchandising integrity fixes**. Phase 9 adds **guided pathway slots
> and ranked candidates, anchored sets resolved from the relation graph, read-time per-currency
> set totals, honest degradation, authoring and moderation, cart seeding, and the nightly
> co-occurrence derivation job**. Phase 11 adds **the `delivery` address kind and its
> authorized decrypt route, indicative delivery estimates, orderable samples with
> refundable-sample credits, and seller-declared customization options**. See
> `docs/STORE_PHASE_5_ROLLOUT.md`
> for the payments/journal contract, `docs/STORE_PHASE_6_ROLLOUT.md` for connector execution,
> `docs/STORE_PHASE_7_ROLLOUT.md` for the trust MVP, `docs/STORE_PHASE_8_ROLLOUT.md` for
> catalog depth, `docs/STORE_PHASE_9_ROLLOUT.md` for guided pathways, and
> `docs/STORE_PHASE_11_ROLLOUT.md` for buyer logistics, and
> `docs/STORE_PHASE_10_ROLLOUT.md` for the public voice, and
> `docs/STORE_PHASE_12_ROLLOUT.md` for seller profile depth. Phase 10 adds **review reads with media,
> sub-scores, helpful votes and seller replies; product Q&A; user-scoped engagement counters;
> content reports with a commerce moderation queue; and pre-sales product inquiries**. Phase 12 adds
> **seller-declared company depth, moderated certifications, and the promised-delivery timestamp
> that makes `onTimeShipmentRate`, reorder rate and measured response time real** — projected as a
> `declaredProfile` object separate from `measuredMetrics`, because a seller's assertion and a
> platform measurement must not be renderable through one code path.
> **Phase 14 settled §14's custody question and built against it:** Qatoto provides no escrow
> and never holds funds, escrow is negotiated between the parties and held by a licensed third
> party reached through a connector, and the default rail is unprotected direct settlement.
> The connector substrate, the external escrow adapter, the four remaining adapter seams and
> the document scanner ship with it; see `docs/STORE_PHASE_14_ROLLOUT.md`.
> **Phase 15 closes Appendix A (`0093`–`0097`):** the customization-option read that made a
> required slot checkoutable at all, helpful votes on answers with per-viewer state on both
> public reads, a supplier directory and the filters matching the facets the platform already
> publishes, category ancestors, per-tier lead time, a participant dispute read, the cross-order
> logistics queue, and buyer-authored trade attachments with the authorized download that makes
> them openable. See `docs/STORE_PHASE_15_ROLLOUT.md`.
> **Phase 16 gave the browse taxonomy an author (`0098`):** `commerce_category` had shipped in
> Phase 0 with public reads and a seed script and no way for anybody to change it, so the
> hierarchy every buyer browses was editable only by hand in psql. Phase 16 adds the staff CRUD
> surface — create with an image, rename, re-parent, reorder a whole sibling set at once, retire
> reversibly — plus `commerce_category_request`, the queue through which a seller asks for a
> category that does not exist yet and a moderator either mints it or says why not. See §4.3 and
> §6.5. It is the first store phase whose frontend shipped **wired rather than mocked**.
> **Phases 17–19 closed the last three buildable Appendix A entries (`0099`–`0105`)** — the
> manufacturer directory, the business forum and the cofounder directory. See §16, §17, §18 and the
> per-phase notes in §12, plus `docs/STORE_PHASE_17_18_19_ROLLOUT.md`.
> Trade-assurance language and real payment processors remain blocked on §14, as do the cofounder
> directory's capital and equity figures — Phase 19 shipped the rest of that surface and stores
> neither. **A10 (public
> product comments) stays deliberately unbuilt** pending the product decision the appendix asks
> for. **Product organization-ownership and category columns are now NOT NULL** —
> migration `0063` closed Phase 0's contract phase, dropping the expand-phase fill trigger
> and making `seller_organization_id`, `created_by_user_id` and `category_id` mandatory.
> `product.seller_id` is gone — migration `0088` dropped it in Phase 14d. The legacy
> `category` column and its `product_category` enum survive and still have eight readers
> under `/products/*`; removing them needs the frontend decision `docs/STORE_PHASE_14_ROLLOUT.md`
> records under "Still open".
>
> **Migrations `0090`–`0091` close two integrity gaps found by auditing this document against
> the code rather than from the frontend side:** `product_image.media_kind` no longer offers a
> `video` value it could never store, and the five seller-writable image columns are
> platform-hosted rather than hotlinked — which is what makes moderating a pathway image mean
> anything (Appendix A21). Three verifier scripts that still asserted against the
> `store_pathway_item` table `0088` dropped were also repaired; the Phase 9 one had been
> throwing `42P01` and losing all twelve of its checks.
>
> **What is NOT built, and what the frontend is standing in for meanwhile:**
> [Appendix A](#appendix-a--what-the-frontend-needs-and-this-backend-does-not-have)
> is the register of every store feature the frontend rendered as mock UI, with the tables,
> columns and routes each one needed. **No entry there now describes a field that reaches the wire
> and can never carry a real value** — `onTimeShipmentRate` was the last one, and Phase 12 supplied
> the promised-delivery timestamp it needed (A13). It is `null` only below its sample threshold, and
> `onTimeSampleSize` rides alongside so "not enough data" is distinguishable from "not wired".
> **After Phase 19 the register's only unbuilt entries are the deliberate ones**: A10 closed pending
> a product decision, A20 blocked on §14, A26 deferred until a category actually sells on two
> dimensions, and the capital half of A34 held behind the same §14 answer A20 is waiting on.
>
> **Phases 17–19 closed the last three buildable entries in the register (`0099`–`0105`)** — A32,
> A33 and A34, specified as §16, §17 and §18. The store frontend had shipped a manufacturer
> directory (`/store/factories`), a business forum (`/store/forum`) and cofounder matching
> (`/store/find-cofounder`), each with a complete Zod wire contract in `src/lib/store/*.schemas.ts`
> and a mock-backed `*.api.ts` beside it, and none of the three had a table, route or service here.
> All three are now served.
>
> **Phase 17** built the manufacturer directory as a projection over Phase 12's seller profile and
> A25's organization search document, resolved §16.2's three conflicts (the capability enum widened
> additively; a nullable `standardCode` beside the free-text certification name; **`site_audited`
> given the audit record it had been asserting without**, never derived from a document review), and
> added the manufacturing inquiry with its own one-to-one thread. `exportMarkets` was decided
> **derived** rather than declared.
>
> **Phase 18** built the forum, and shipped the reply, accept-answer and helpful writes alongside
> the thread create rather than after it — a forum with only thread-create is a wall of unanswerable
> questions. `pending_review` on create is what keeps A10 closed while a public text surface exists.
>
> **Phase 19** built the cofounder directory **without any capital or equity column**, which is §14's
> deferral honoured literally rather than waited on: the surface and its whole lifecycle are live,
> and both wire fields serve `null` until a lawyer answers per market. A verifier asserts that
> absence so nobody adds the columns by accident.
>
> **Community is a sibling context, and Phase 18 introduced the `/community` mount to say so** (§1.1).
> Forum and cofounder READS live under `/store` because that is the prefix a signed-out visitor
> browses; their writes do not.
>
> **A31 and A35 are the other direction, and both matter more than they look.** A31 records a
> feature this document did not describe because it shipped after the last documentation pass, not
> because it is missing. A35 records **eighteen routes the backend serves that §5 and §6 never
> listed**, plus two places where a shipped response and the frontend's parser disagree. A document
> that undercounts what exists sends somebody to build it twice.
>
> **A23–A30 were added by auditing this document from the frontend side after Phase 14, and three
> of them described defects in shipped features rather than missing ones.** A23 was a commercial
> term the backend enforced at `checkout/prepare` and never projected, so a product carrying a
> required customization option could not be checked out by anybody. A30 was a request field no
> route could fill. A28 was a dispute with no reader but platform staff. **Phase 15 closed every
> buildable entry in the register (`0093`–`0097`)**; see `docs/STORE_PHASE_15_ROLLOUT.md`. What
> remains open there is recorded under "Still open" rather than left to be rediscovered — chiefly
> that `getCategoryFacets` and `/store/search` now compute from different tables and can drift.
>
> The `trending_placeholder` rail strategy still returns an empty list unconditionally and always
> will — **Phase 13 shipped `trending` and `recommended` alongside it**, and the placeholder is kept
> forever so that backing the ranking engine out stays a per-rail data edit rather than a deploy. Checkout
> `shippingInCents` is still written literal `0` (`commerce-checkout.service.ts:515-517` and
> `:807-809`) — Phase 8 supplies the weight and dimensions A16 needs to rate freight, but not the
> estimate itself, and A16 records that as the decision rather than the gap.

## 0. The rule that governs the store

**The frontend is hostile. The Express backend is the only authority.**

The client may display a price, quantity, verification badge, delivery estimate, insurance limit,
exchange rate, tax estimate, or order status. It may never establish any of them.

- Identity comes from the authenticated session. Organization membership and role are loaded on
  every protected action; `buyerOrganizationId`, `sellerOrganizationId`, and `providerOrganizationId`
  are never trusted merely because they appear in a body.
- Public catalog reads expose only active products whose owning organization is allowed to trade.
  A direct request for a draft, suspended, or deleted listing returns `404`.
- Price tiers, stock, quote totals, taxes, fees, payment amounts, exchange rates, and refunds are
  reloaded or recomputed in the same transaction that performs the state transition.
- Accepting a quote snapshots commercial terms. Later edits to a product, service offering, company
  profile, or tax rule cannot rewrite an accepted order.
- Provider verification is server-owned. Uploading a certificate creates evidence awaiting review;
  it never grants a badge.
- A browse-country preference is display-only. Compliance, tax, sanctions, export control, and
  availability decisions use server-derived and verified facts.
- Every mutation is authorized for the exact organization and resource. A valid account is not
  automatically a buyer, seller, provider, or moderator.
- Expensive or replayable writes use an idempotency key minted once per user attempt. Duplicate
  requests return the original result.
- Payment-provider, carrier, laboratory, insurer, and FX webhooks are authenticated, deduplicated,
  persisted before processing, and applied by workers.
- Expected failures are `Result<T, E>` values. Controllers exhaustively map them to HTTP responses.

**Qatoto is a marketplace, and never a principal.** It provides no freight, no escrow, no
insurance, no customs brokerage and no inspection. It lists providers who do, and the buyer engages
them; the buyer's counterparty on any such engagement is the **provider organization**, never the
platform. Three consequences bind the backend:

- **A provider-sourced number is the provider's.** It travels with the identity of whoever quoted
  it, and the wire shape must make rendering it _without_ that identity impossible rather than
  merely discouraged — the mechanism A13 already established for declared-versus-measured stats.
  §19.9's `providerQuote` is the freight instance of this.
- **A quote is not a booking.** Rating from a card reserves nothing, confers no capacity, and
  writes no money into an order.
- **The platform states no guarantee it does not itself perform.** §14 decided the custody half of
  this — Qatoto is not a custodian and never holds funds — and A20 keeps the trade-protection copy
  behind that decision.

This was implied in six places and stated in none until Phase 20. It is stated here because a rule
that lives only in the shape of the code is a rule the next surface can violate by accident.

If a rule must remain true after DevTools changes or request replay, it belongs in this backend.

## 1. Scope and bounded contexts

### 1.1 What this domain owns

| Context             | Owns                                                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commerce identity   | Organizations, memberships, trade roles, addresses, verification evidence        |
| Public catalog      | Active product projections, categories, search, facets, storefronts              |
| Merchandising       | Hero slides, rails, placements, guided pathway sets and slots, product relations |
| Service marketplace | Provider profiles, capabilities, service offerings, coverage, credentials        |
| Sourcing            | RFQs, invitations, requirement lines, quote revisions, negotiation               |
| Purchasing          | Carts, checkout groups, purchase orders, immutable commercial snapshots          |
| Payments            | Commerce payment intents, provider adapter references, refunds, reconciliation   |
| Fulfillment         | Product shipments and connector engagements                                      |
| Trust               | Trade-assurance cases, disputes, reviews, Q&A, reports, moderation               |
| Communication       | Resource-scoped threads, participants, messages, attachment metadata             |
| Taxonomy            | The browse category tree, its ordering and imagery, and the seller request queue |

**Community is a sibling context, not a row in that table.** The business forum (§17) and cofounder
profiles (§18) are public text written by people, attached to a commerce platform's domain and
sharing none of commerce's nouns — no organization is required to post, nothing is priced, nothing is
ordered. They own `community_*` tables and mount their writes at `/community/*`.

**Their public reads still live under `/store/*`, and that is a mount point rather than a context
claim.** The precedent is already in the code: `commerceProductEngagementRouter` mounts at `/store`
(`src/app.ts:228`) while owning no store table. `/store` is the prefix a signed-out visitor browses;
`/commerce` and `/community` are where the two write surfaces live. Do not read
`GET /store/forum/threads` as evidence that a forum thread is a commerce object — the section it is
specified in is the authority, not the path.

### 1.2 What this domain does not own

- Seller listing authoring remains under `/products/*`.
- The R&D `/suppliers/*` directory remains a project go-to-market domain. Its supplier quotes and
  engagements do not become store orders.
- R&D compensation records are attestations about payment elsewhere. They are not checkout.
- The project-funding ledger remains project-scoped. Commerce uses a separate journal namespace or
  separate commerce ledger tables, even if it reuses accounting code and provider adapters.
- Product research, proof of effort, equity, and programme contribution do not affect store price,
  provider verification, or order entitlement.
- Forum threads and cofounder profiles are **community**, not commerce (§1.1). A forum reply confers
  no standing in a dispute, a cofounder profile is not an organization, and neither may be joined to
  a commerce row to imply either. The one hard rule underneath: **nothing on the community surface
  may be read as a commercial fact about a party**, because no order, payment or verification stands
  behind any of it.

### 1.3 One organization may participate in several roles

One `commerce_organization` may be a buyer, product seller, and one or more provider kinds. Roles
do not imply one another. A freight forwarder can buy office equipment without becoming a verified
seller; a manufacturer can sell products without being approved to broker customs.

The existing R&D `supplier` row may optionally link to a commerce organization after moderator
review. The link avoids duplicate company identity but imports **no trust state, quote, price, or
project engagement**.

## 2. Core architecture decisions

### 2.1 Products and services are not one polymorphic listing

Products have inventory, images, variants, and quantity tiers. Services have coverage, eligibility,
capacity, evidence, and quote-specific requirements. A single nullable `listing` table would allow
invalid combinations such as stock on an insurance policy or warehouse capacity on a chair.

Therefore:

- Existing `product` tables remain product-specific.
- `commerce_service_offering` stores the common provider-facing contract.
- Exactly one typed extension row describes each service offering.
- RFQs, quote revisions, and orders have separate product-line and service-line tables.
- Explicit link tables connect a service engagement to an order or shipment when applicable.

### 2.2 An accepted quote is immutable

Negotiation creates append-only `commerce_quote_revision` rows. Editing means creating the next
revision, never updating the previous one. Acceptance locks one revision and creates an order from
that snapshot in one transaction.

### 2.3 A checkout group is not a multi-party order

A buyer action may involve several counterparties. The backend creates:

- one `commerce_checkout_group` for buyer-facing coordination; and
- one `commerce_order` per seller/provider organization.

This prevents one late warehouse provider from blocking a manufacturer’s shipment and keeps
authorization, invoicing, refunds, and disputes attributable to one counterparty.

### 2.4 Search and ranking are backend work

Catalog filtering, faceting, ranking, recommendation candidate selection, and pagination run in
PostgreSQL/services. The frontend never downloads a page and pretends it searched the catalog.
Personalization may rerank eligible candidates, but sponsored placement is always labelled and
never bypasses eligibility or moderation filters.

Controllers do not contain domain decisions. Services do not inspect raw Express requests.
Adapters translate external provider protocols into internal tagged results.

## 4. Data model

All table names are snake_case; Drizzle property names are camelCase. IDs are opaque text values
generated with `randomUUID()`. Timestamps are UTC. Public slugs are kebab-case and immutable after
publication; changing a display name does not change a URL identity.

### 4.1 Commerce organizations

`commerce_organization`

- `id`, immutable `slug`, `legalName`, `displayName`, `summary`
- `organizationType`: `company | sole_proprietor | cooperative | government | nonprofit`
- `tradeState`: `pending | active | suspended | closed`
- `countryCode`, `registrationNumberEncrypted`, `taxIdentifierEncrypted`
- `logoUrl`, `websiteUrl`, `createdByUserId`, timestamps
- unique slug; normalized legal-name/country lookup; encrypted identifiers never appear publicly

`commerce_organization_member`

- `organizationId`, `userId`
- `role`: `owner | administrator | buyer | seller | provider_operator | finance | support | viewer`
- `state`: `invited | active | suspended | left`
- `invitedByUserId`, `joinedAt`, `leftAt`
- unique `(organizationId, userId)` for an active membership

`commerce_organization_address`

- organization-owned billing, registered, warehouse, pickup, and return addresses
- normalized country/region/locality/postal fields plus encrypted contact details
- buyer delivery addresses are private; public storefront locations use an explicit public projection

`commerce_organization_verification`

- `verificationKind`, `state`, evidence object key, reviewer, decision reason, timestamps
- evidence upload never modifies `tradeState` or provider badges directly

### 4.2 Migrating shipped products to organization ownership

The shipped `product.sellerId` points to a Better Auth user. Migration must not break Studio.

1. Add nullable `sellerOrganizationId` and `createdByUserId`.
2. Create one private seller organization for each existing seller and backfill active products.
3. Update `/products/*` authorization to require an active seller membership and derive the
   organization from the session/context. During transition, preserve owner-only behavior.
4. Make `sellerOrganizationId` non-null after backfill verification.
5. Retain `createdByUserId` for attribution. Remove or rename legacy `sellerId` only in a later
   migration after all callers use organization ownership.

No request body chooses arbitrary ownership. Organization switching uses a server-issued active
organization context and rechecks membership.

### 4.3 Category migration

The shipped `product_category` enum has eight seller categories. Buyer browse needs a hierarchy.

`commerce_category`

- `id`, immutable `slug`, `name`, `parentCategoryId`, `siblingOrder`
- `state`: `draft | active | retired`
- `imageUrl`, `searchSynonyms`, timestamps
- unique slug; unique sibling order per parent; no cycles (service check plus constraint trigger)

Migration:

1. Seed roots corresponding to the eight legacy enum values.
2. Add nullable `product.categoryId`, backfill from the enum, and dual-write temporarily.
3. Change Studio to submit `categoryId`; backend verifies an active leaf category.
4. Make `categoryId` non-null.
5. Retain the old enum only until old clients and migrations are retired.

Product enum values remain snake_case. Public category slugs remain kebab-case. These are separate
wire concepts and must not be converted into each other implicitly.

#### 4.3a Who edits the tree — **SHIPPED (Phase 16, `0098`)**

The block above shipped in Phase 0 with public reads and a seed script and **no way for anybody to
change it**. The hierarchy every buyer browses was editable only by hand in psql, and a seller whose
product fitted no existing category had nowhere to say so. Phase 16 closes both.

`commerce_category_request`

- `id`, `requestedByUserId`, `requestedOrganizationId` — both `ON DELETE SET NULL`, because a
  deleted account must not pin a decided request and the verdict stays a fact about the taxonomy
  after its author is gone
- `proposedName` — what the seller typed, **not a slug**
- `proposedParentCategoryId` — where the seller thinks it belongs; `null` means "a new root"
- `justification`
- `state`: `pending | approved | rejected`
- `reviewedByUserId`, `reviewedAt`, `reviewNote`, `resultingCategoryId`, timestamps
- queue index `(state, createdAt, id)` — the same shape as `store_pathway_moderation_queue_idx`
- `CHECK (reviewed_at IS NULL) = (state = 'pending')`, a `resultingCategoryId` only on the approve
  arm, and `review_note NOT NULL` on the reject arm

**Why it is its own table and not a `pending` state on `commerce_category`.** A request is a
different thing from a category: it has an author, a justification and a verdict, and it has no place
in the tree — no `siblingOrder`, no children, no products. Proposals living in `commerce_category`
would mean either excluding a state from every browse query forever, where one forgotten `WHERE` puts
unapproved user text on the storefront, or minting a fake `siblingOrder` to satisfy an index that
exists to order things users can actually see.

**A pending request does not block the listing.** The seller publishes immediately, the product parks
in `misc`, and `product.pendingCategoryRequestId` points back at the request. That column is the
**only** link, and it is what makes approval surgical: the verdict rehomes the products belonging to
_this_ request and leaves genuine `misc` listings alone. Repointing by `WHERE category_id = misc`
would sweep up unrelated sellers' products, so no code path may do it.

Five rules the shipped surface enforces, each of which a future edit will be tempted to relax:

- **`childCount` and `productCount` are DERIVED and appear in no request body.** They are what the
  retire guard reads. A client able to set them could talk that guard into hiding a category that
  still has listings under it.
- **There is no DELETE, deliberately.** `product.categoryId` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT` and the demand
  snapshots cascade, so removal would either fail or take history with it. `retire` is reversible
  removal from browse and is the only exit.
- **`slug` is absent from the PATCH body**, and the body is `.strict()` so sending it is a 422. A
  slug is a public URL identity — linked and indexed the moment the category is published — and a
  category that needs a different one is a new category.
- **The moderator chooses the slug, not the requester.** It exists only on the approve arm of the
  verdict, which is a discriminated union: a rejection _requires_ a note, an approval does not.
- **Route order is load-bearing.** Express matches in declaration order, so the literal
  `/admin/categories/reorder` must precede `/admin/categories/:categoryId` or every reorder 404s with
  `"reorder"` captured as a category id.

The `moderate_commerce` check runs **inside the service, not as route middleware** — so it returns a
`Result` that takes part in the controller's exhaustive error switch, and so it can be proven to run
before any id is read. This is the §11 rule about id oracles, applied.

Eleven `platform_audit_event_kind` members ship with it: `commerce_category_created`,
`commerce_category_updated`, `commerce_category_reordered`, `commerce_category_image_replaced`,
`commerce_category_retired`, `commerce_category_request_approved`,
`commerce_category_request_rejected`, alongside the four `commerce_content_*` members Phase 10 added.

### 4.4 Public product extensions

The public catalog reuses `product`, `product_image`, and `product_pricing_tier`, adding only fields
that a buyer contract needs:

- `product.publicSlug`
- optional `product.modelNumber`, `countryOfOriginCode`, `unitOfMeasure`
- `product.samplePolicy`: `unavailable | paid | refundable`
- optional server-owned `samplePriceInCents`
- `product.leadTimeMinDays`, `leadTimeMaxDays`
- `product.moderationState`: `pending | approved | rejected | suspended`
- optional structured specification schema/value tables

An active seller status alone is insufficient for public visibility: product status, moderation,
organization trade state, and category state must all be eligible.

### 4.5 Provider profiles and offerings

`commerce_provider_profile`

- `organizationId` primary key
- public summary, support policy, response-time statistics
- `verificationState`: `unverified | documents_pending | verified | rejected | suspended`
- `acceptingRequests`, service-region summary, timestamps

`commerce_provider_kind`

- seeded values:
    - `freight_forwarder`
    - `logistics_operator`
    - `customs_broker`
    - `insurance_provider`
    - `inspection_agency`
    - `testing_certification_lab`
    - `marketing_agency`
    - `warehouse_provider`
    - `foreign_exchange_facilitator`

`commerce_provider_kind_link` is many-to-many because one verified organization may operate, for
example, freight forwarding and warehousing. Verification is recorded per kind, not globally.

`commerce_service_offering`

- `id`, immutable `slug`, `providerOrganizationId`, `providerKind`
- `title`, `summary`, `state`: `draft | pending_review | active | suspended | retired`
- `pricingModel`: `quote_only | fixed_fee | per_unit | subscription`
- optional public indicative price range in integer cents plus server-owned currency
- `minimumLeadTimeDays`, `maximumLeadTimeDays`
- timestamps and moderation attribution

`commerce_service_coverage`

- offering, origin/destination country or seeded region, optional port/airport/location identifiers
- capability flags are filter inputs, not proof that a provider may legally serve a route

Typed one-to-one extension tables:

- `freight_offering_detail`: supported `air | sea | land | rail | multimodal`, consolidation,
  container and hazardous-goods capabilities
- `customs_brokerage_offering_detail`: jurisdictions, import/export direction, commodity coverage
- `insurance_offering_detail`: cargo coverage classes, limit ranges, exclusions-document reference
- `inspection_offering_detail`: pre-production, during-production, pre-shipment, loading supervision
- `testing_certification_offering_detail`: standards, accreditation bodies, laboratory locations
- `marketing_offering_detail`: channels, target regions, language capabilities, engagement model
- `warehouse_offering_detail`: storage types, temperature control, bonded status, capacity units
- `foreign_exchange_offering_detail`: currency pairs, settlement rails, minimum/maximum notional

The service verifies exactly one extension row matches `providerKind`. No generic JSON blob decides
eligibility or pricing.

### 4.6 RFQs and invitations

`commerce_rfq`

- buyer organization, creator, title, description
- `state`: `draft | open | closed | awarded | cancelled | expired`
- response deadline, desired delivery window, destination, settlement currency
- visibility: `invited_only | matched_providers`
- timestamps

`commerce_rfq_product_line`

- product reference nullable when sourcing an unlisted product
- immutable requested title/specification snapshot, quantity, unit, target category

`commerce_rfq_service_line`

- provider kind, service offering optional, common requirement summary
- typed requirement extension table matching the provider kind
- may link to a product line without becoming its child lifecycle

`commerce_rfq_invitation`

- RFQ + provider organization, state, sent/read/responded timestamps
- unique `(rfqId, providerOrganizationId)`

Opening an RFQ validates buyer organization state, deadline, at least one valid line, document
ownership, and all required service-specific fields.

### 4.7 Quote revisions

`commerce_quote`

- RFQ, provider organization, status: `draft | submitted | superseded | accepted | declined |
withdrawn | expired`
- latest revision number, timestamps
- unique provider per RFQ unless the buyer explicitly re-invites after closure

`commerce_quote_revision`

- quote, monotonic revision number, currency, validity deadline
- subtotal, tax, service fee, shipping, discount, and total in integer cents
- payment terms, Incoterm when relevant, notes, createdByMemberId
- `incoterm` is the `commerce_incoterm` ENUM since Phase 23 (`0115`/`0116`, A40) — Incoterms 2020,
  the eleven the ICC publishes. It was free text under a 20-character length check, which accepted
  `BANANA`, and `commerce_prevent_submitted_quote_revision_mutation` then froze the bad value on the
  revision forever
- immutable after submission

`commerce_quote_product_line` and `commerce_quote_service_line`

- reference the matching RFQ line
- quantity and unit price/fee components
- immutable title, scope, lead time, exclusions, and deliverable snapshots
- typed service quote extensions for route legs, insurance coverage, test standards, storage
  capacity, marketing deliverables, and FX rate details

For FX, rates are fixed-point integers plus an explicit scale or canonical decimal strings parsed
by a decimal library on the backend. JavaScript/Postgres floating point is forbidden for money or
exchange rates.

### 4.8 Cart, reservations, checkout, and orders

`commerce_cart` belongs to one buyer organization. `commerce_cart_product_line` stores product,
quantity, and selected variant/options only. It does not store an authoritative total.

`commerce_inventory_reservation`

- product/variant, organization/cart, quantity, expiration, state
- created during checkout preparation using row locks
- released by worker on expiry; consumed atomically by order creation

`commerce_checkout_group`

- buyer organization, state, server-computed aggregate display totals, idempotency key

`commerce_order`

- checkout group nullable for quote-originated orders
- buyer and one counterparty organization
- source: `direct_checkout | accepted_quote`
- `state`: `pending_payment | payment_processing | confirmed | in_fulfillment |
partially_completed | completed | cancelled | disputed`
- immutable legal names, addresses, currency, totals, terms, and accepted quote revision
- `incoterm_snapshot` carries the same `commerce_incoterm` enum as the revision it is copied from
  (Phase 23, `0116`, A40). It carried NO constraint of any kind before that — a snapshot less
  constrained than its source, which is how a term the revision could never have stated could still
  appear on the order

`commerce_order_product_line` and `commerce_order_service_line`

- immutable commercial snapshots
- product line has ordered, reserved, fulfilled, cancelled, and refunded quantities
- service line points to a separately stateful connector engagement

### 4.9 Payments and journal

Commerce does not post into project-funding rows. It introduces:

- `commerce_payment_intent`
- `commerce_provider_transfer`
- `commerce_refund`
- `commerce_journal_account`
- `commerce_journal_entry`
- `commerce_journal_line`

The journal is double-entry and append-only. Provider calls are made only after the local transfer
row and idempotency key are committed. Webhook receipt is stored before state transition.

**WHAT A PAYMENT POSTS DEPENDS ON THE ORDER'S RAIL** (Phase 24, A41). `direct_processor` records
`settlement_funding_memo → settlement_released_memo` under the `direct_settled` entry kind, with no
custody hop, because the processor settles buyer straight to seller; the frozen `internal_custody`
rail keeps `buyer_clearing → order_held` so historical orders stay readable. A payment intent is
refused outright on `direct_offline` and `external_escrow`, which settle elsewhere. Until Phase 24
every rail posted the frozen pair, so no payment could settle at all.

Payment state:

`created → requires_action | processing → authorized → settled`

Terminal alternatives: `failed | cancelled | partially_refunded | refunded | disputed`.

“Trade assurance” copy is not enabled until the legal custody model, eligible payment method,
dispute rules, and journal postings are implemented. Qatoto must never claim funds are escrowed
merely because an order row exists.

### 4.10 Fulfillment and loose connector engagements

`commerce_service_engagement`

- accepted service quote/order line, provider organization, buyer organization
- `state`: `awaiting_provider | scheduled | in_progress | awaiting_buyer | completed |
cancelled | disputed`
- independent timestamps and deliverable acceptance

`commerce_order_service_link`

- explicitly links an engagement to an order, product line, or shipment
- absence is valid: a company may buy lab testing or marketing without buying a product on Qatoto

`commerce_shipment`

- one seller order, origin/destination snapshots, state, package totals

`commerce_shipment_leg`

- ordered legs with mode `air | sea | land | rail`
- optional freight/logistics engagement
- carrier references and tracking events are append-only

Customs, insurance, inspection, laboratory, warehouse, marketing, and FX each receive typed
engagement detail/deliverable tables. Completion of one never directly marks another complete.
An order coordinator derives aggregate progress for display.

### 4.11 Communication, trust, and moderation

Threads are resource-scoped: RFQ, quote, order, service engagement, or dispute. Participants are
derived from organization memberships. Attachment object keys are private and served through
short-lived authorized URLs.

Reviews require a completed order/engagement and are unique per reviewer organization/resource.
Provider metrics are backend aggregates over eligible records, never client submissions.

Reports and disputes preserve snapshots, messages, evidence, moderator actions, and an append-only
audit event. A seller/provider cannot review or resolve its own case.

## 5. Public Store API

Public reads use `attachOptionalUser`, strict query parsing, bounded limits, deterministic ordering,
and buyer-safe projections.

| Method | Route                                            | Purpose                                                               |

| GET    | `/store/factories`                               | Manufacturer directory — §16 (Phase 17)                               |
| GET    | `/store/factories/:factorySlug`                  | One factory: lines, certifications, sites, audit — §16 (Phase 17)     |
| GET    | `/store/forum/threads`                           | Board-filtered thread list — §17 (Phase 18)                           |
| GET    | `/store/forum/threads/:threadSlug`               | One thread and a cursor page of replies — §17 (Phase 18)              |
| GET    | `/store/cofounder-profiles`                      | Cofounder directory, `published` only — §18 (Phase 19)                |
| GET    | `/store/cofounder-profiles/:profileSlug`         | One cofounder profile — §18 (Phase 19)                                |

**Every row in this table resolves today.** The last six were marked NOT BUILT until Phases 17–19
shipped them; the marking is kept in the git history rather than in the table, because a table that
carries stale warnings is one nobody reads.

The two forum rows and the two cofounder rows are **community, not commerce** (§1.1). `/store` is
where they are mounted because it is the prefix a signed-out visitor browses; their WRITES are at
`/community` (§6.6). Do not read `GET /store/forum/threads` as evidence that a forum thread is a
commerce object.

`/store/search` also accepts `documentKind=organization` — the supplier directory — and the facet
filters `priceMinInCents`, `priceMaxInCents`, `stockState`, `samplePolicy`, `condition`,
`verificationState` and `leadTimeMaxDays` (A25). `/store/categories/:slug` carries `ancestors[]`.

Reads that admit an optional session project a `viewer` member when one resolves and `null`
otherwise — never a defaulted `false` (A11, A24). Public product detail carries
`customizationOptions[]` (A23) and `leadTimeDays` on each pricing tier (A27).

`category-slugs` and `pathway-slugs` mock endpoints are not durable public API requirements.
Dynamic routes should render on demand; build-time static parameter generation may use a bounded
featured-slug endpoint only if the deployment model requires it.

Example search:

```text
GET /store/search?query=solar+freezer&category=industrial-cooling
  &minOrderQuantityMax=50&sellerCountryCode=IN
  &providerKind=freight_forwarder&sort=relevance&limit=24&cursor=...
```

Query keys are camelCase. Enum values are snake_case. Category and product slugs are kebab-case.

### 5.1 Buyer-safe product projection

Public product detail includes:

- immutable ID and public slug
- title, brand, description, key features, category trail, specifications
- ordered public image URLs
- current currency and pricing tiers in integer cents
- stock state (`in_stock | low_stock | made_to_order | unavailable`), not private stock counts
- sample policy, lead-time range, MOQ, origin, moderation-safe seller projection
- server-derived review and fulfillment metrics

It excludes seller SKU internals when private, exact inventory, private contacts, draft fields,
organization member IDs, moderation notes, and storage object keys.

## 6. Authenticated Commerce API

### 6.1 Organizations and providers

| Method | Route                                                       | Result                                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/commerce/organizations`                                   | Create pending organization; idempotent                         |
| GET    | `/commerce/organizations/mine`                              | Membership-scoped organizations                                 |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/organizations/:organizationId`                   | Authorized profile update; `countryCode` completes an A37 shell |
| POST   | `/commerce/organizations/:organizationId/members`           | Invite member                                                   |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/organizations/:organizationId/members/:memberId` | Role/state update                                               |
| POST   | `/commerce/providers/:organizationId/profile`               | Create provider profile                                         |
| POST   | `/commerce/providers/:organizationId/offerings`             | Create draft offering                                           |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/service-offerings/:offeringId`                   | Update owned draft                                              |
| POST   | `/commerce/service-offerings/:offeringId/submit`            | Submit for moderation                                           |
| POST   | `/commerce/providers/:organizationId/evidence`              | Upload verification evidence                                    |

Moderation routes live under the existing platform capability model and are not granted by an
organization role.

**Which guard each authenticated route carries changed in Phase 21, and A35's rule applies to that
too.** The routes below now run on `requireProvisionedBuyerCommerceWorkspace`, which admits a
`pending` workspace and mints one on first use (§14, A37): `GET|PUT|DELETE /commerce/cart*`,
`POST /commerce/cart/from-pathway/:pathwaySlug`, `POST /commerce/checkout/prepare`,
`POST /commerce/rfqs`, `PATCH /commerce/rfqs/:rfqId`, `GET /commerce/rfqs/mine`,
`POST /commerce/products/:productId/inquiries`, `GET /commerce/inquiries`,
`POST /commerce/threads`, `GET|POST /commerce/threads/:threadId/messages`, and both
`/commerce/documents` routes. **Everything else is unchanged**, including the four gates §14 named:
`POST /commerce/checkout/confirm`, `POST /commerce/rfqs/:rfqId/open`,
`POST /commerce/rfqs/:rfqId/invitations`, every seller listing write and every provider offering
write.

### 6.2 RFQs and quotes

| Method | Route                                                  | Result                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/commerce/rfqs`                                       | Create buyer draft                   |
| GET    | `/commerce/rfqs/mine`                                  | Buyer organization RFQs              |
| GET    | `/commerce/rfqs/:rfqId`                                | Authorized RFQ projection            |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/rfqs/:rfqId`                                | Update owned draft                   |
| POST   | `/commerce/rfqs/:rfqId/open`                           | Validate and open                    |
| POST   | `/commerce/rfqs/:rfqId/invitations`                    | Invite eligible providers            |
| POST   | `/commerce/rfqs/:rfqId/close`                          | Close responses                      |
| GET    | `/commerce/provider/rfqs`                              | Invited/matched provider work queue  |
| POST   | `/commerce/rfqs/:rfqId/quotes`                         | Provider creates quote shell         |
| POST   | `/commerce/quotes/:quoteId/revisions`                  | Append draft revision                |
| POST   | `/commerce/quotes/:quoteId/revisions/:revision/submit` | Submit immutable revision            |
| POST   | `/commerce/quotes/:quoteId/accept`                     | Buyer accepts latest valid revision  |
| POST   | `/commerce/quotes/:quoteId/decline`                    | Buyer declines                       |
| POST   | `/commerce/quotes/:quoteId/withdraw`                   | Provider withdraws before acceptance |

Quote acceptance uses `If-Match`/version or expected revision in a strict body, locks the quote and
RFQ, validates expiry and authority, then creates order snapshots atomically.

### 6.3 Cart, checkout, orders, and payments

| Method | Route                                       | Result                                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/commerce/cart`                            | Active organization cart with server-priced projection    |
| PUT    | `/commerce/cart/items/:productId`           | Set desired quantity                                      |
| DELETE | `/commerce/cart/items/:productId`           | Remove line                                               |
| POST   | `/commerce/checkout/prepare`                | Validate cart, reserve stock, return authoritative totals |
| POST   | `/commerce/checkout/confirm`                | Create checkout group and counterparty orders             |
| GET    | `/commerce/orders`                          | Buyer orders, cursor paginated                            |
| GET    | `/commerce/orders/:orderId`                 | Authorized order detail                                   |
| GET    | `/commerce/provider/orders`                 | Seller/provider work queue                                |
| POST   | `/commerce/orders/:orderId/cancel`          | Policy-checked cancellation                               |
| POST   | `/commerce/orders/:orderId/payment-intents` | Create/reuse payment intent                               |
| GET    | `/commerce/payments/:paymentIntentId`       | Poll payment state                                        |
| POST   | `/commerce/orders/:orderId/refunds`         | Authorized refund request                                 |

All create/confirm/payment/refund calls require `Idempotency-Key`. A `202` means processing has
started, not that payment, booking, testing, or settlement succeeded.

### 6.4 Fulfillment, messages, and trust

**`paymentIntentId` joined both order projections** rather than becoming a list route. An order
carries at most one live intent — `commerce_payment_intent_active_order_uidx` is what makes that
true — so the order is where the id belongs, and `POST /orders/:orderId/payment-intents` finally
has a reader that survives a page reload.

### 6.5 Category taxonomy administration — **SHIPPED (Phase 16, `0098`)**

| Method | Route                                                 | Result                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/commerce/category-requests`                         | A seller asks for a category that does not exist |
| GET    | `/commerce/category-requests/mine`                    | The seller's own requests and their verdicts     |
| GET    | `/commerce/admin/categories`                          | The whole tree, draft and retired included       |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/categories`                          | Create; multipart, optional `image` field        |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/admin/categories/reorder`                  | Sets one parent's WHOLE sibling order at once    |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/admin/categories/:categoryId`              | Name, parent, synonyms, state — never `slug`     |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/admin/categories/:categoryId/image`        | Replace the image in place; multipart            |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/categories/:categoryId/retire`       | Out of browse, reversibly. There is no DELETE    |
| GET    | `/commerce/admin/category-requests`                   | The moderation queue, `?state=` filtered         |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/category-requests/:requestId/decide` | The terminal verdict                             |

The eight `/admin/*` routes are gated by the `moderate_commerce` platform capability, checked
in-service (§4.3a). The two seller routes are the only non-staff writes here and they touch a
different table: a request mints nothing, and only a moderator's verdict creates a category. The
`POST` additionally carries `requireIdentifiedUser`, because `src/lib/auth.ts` registers the
`anonymous()` plugin and a session therefore proves nothing about identity on its own — **a request
nobody can be traced to is a request nobody can act on**. The `/mine` read does not need it: a caller
who cannot be identified has no requests to return.

**Reorder takes the whole set, not one move.** The body is `{ parentCategoryId, categoryIds[] }` and
must be an exact permutation of that parent's children. A per-row "move up" would have to write
intermediate orders that violate `commerce_category_siblingOrder_uidx` mid-transaction; taking the
final arrangement in one call means the unique index never sees an illegal state.

**The verdict body is a discriminated union, mirroring the decision rather than flattening it:**

- `{ decision: "approve", slug, name?, parentCategoryId?, note?, productAssignments? }`
- `{ decision: "reject", note, productAssignments? }`

`note` is required on the reject arm and optional on the approve arm, and `slug` exists only on
approve. **Both arms accept `productAssignments[]`** — `{ productId, categoryId }` pairs that override
the verdict's default target — because a rejection still has to put the waiting listings somewhere,
and a moderator reading the request often finds one of them belongs in a category that already
exists. That is also why the queue projects `waitingProducts` as **named titles rather than a
count**: a number tells a moderator how much work there is, a title tells them the request was
unnecessary.

### 6.6 Manufacturer directory writes — **SHIPPED (Phase 17, `0099`–`0101`)**

| Method | Route                                                       | Result                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/commerce/factories/:factorySlug/inquiries`                | Create; answers `draft`. **Idempotency-Key**  |
| GET    | `/commerce/factories/inquiries/mine`                        | The buyer's own inquiries, any state          |
| GET    | `/commerce/factories/inquiries/received`                    | The factory's queue; drafts are never in it   |
| GET    | `/commerce/factories/inquiries/:inquiryId`                  | One inquiry, for either party                 |
| POST   | `/commerce/factories/inquiries/:inquiryId/send`             | `draft` → `sent`; opens the one-to-one thread |
| POST   | `/commerce/factories/inquiries/:inquiryId/answer`           | The factory marks it answered                 |
| POST   | `/commerce/factories/inquiries/:inquiryId/close`            | Either party, from any state but `closed`     |
| PUT    | `/commerce/organizations/:organizationId/production-lines`  | Replace the whole named-line list             |
| PUT    | `/commerce/organizations/:organizationId/sites`             | Replace the whole per-site list               |
| PUT    | `/commerce/organizations/:organizationId/factory-terms`     | Sample policy, MOQ, lead times, inbox switch  |
| GET    | `/commerce/admin/organizations/:organizationId/site-audits` | Every audit on one organization               |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/organizations/:organizationId/site-audits` | Record one. **Idempotency-Key**               |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/site-audits/:auditId/withdraw`             | Retract it, with a required reason            |

Literal `/factories/inquiries/*` paths are declared **before** `/factories/:factorySlug/inquiries`,
which is the same depth; `commerce-factories.routes.order.test.ts` asserts it.

**`factory-terms` is a whole-object PUT and not part of the seller-profile PATCH**, because both its
invariants are cross-field: a sample fee is only meaningful when samples are offered, and a MOQ is
only readable beside its unit. A partial patch could not validate either without first reading the
stored row and merging.

The two audit routes are gated by `moderate_commerce`, checked in-service. **A site audit is never
derived from a document review** (§16.2), and the public detail read projects only `lastAuditedAt` —
publishing an auditor's name and scope on a browse page is a disclosure about a third party nobody
consented to.

### 6.7 Community writes — **SHIPPED (Phases 18–19, `0102`–`0105`)**

**Mounted at `/community`, not `/commerce`** (§1.1). Their public reads are in §5.

| Method      | Route                                                     | Result                                            |

| GET         | `/community/admin/forum/threads`                          | The moderation queue                              |
| POST        | `/community/admin/forum/threads/:threadId/moderate`       | `publish` / `reject` / `lock` / `unlock`          |
| POST        | `/community/admin/forum/replies/:replyId/moderate`        | `hidden` / `restored`                             |
| GET         | `/community/admin/content-reports`                        | The community report queue                        |
| POST        | `/community/admin/content-reports/:reportId/decisions`    | Dismiss a report                                  |
| POST        | `/community/cofounder-profiles`                           | Create your own; answers `draft`. Idempotency-Key |
| GET         | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine`                      | The viewer's own profile in any state             |
| PATCH       | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine`                      | Edit while `draft` or `withdrawn`                 |
| POST        | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine/submit`               | `draft` → `pending_review`                        |
| POST        | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine/withdraw`             | Out of the directory, reversibly                  |
| PATCH       | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine/engagement-state`     | The one edit a `published` profile may make       |

| POST        | `/community/admin/cofounder-profiles/:profileId/moderate` | `publish` / `reject`                              |

Every authoring route carries `requireIdentifiedUser`; the moderation routes do not, because their
gate is `moderate_content` checked in-service. **A rejected thread stays `pending_review` with its
reason**, which is what keeps it out of every public read while remaining readable on `/mine` — and
the queue predicate is therefore `state = 'pending_review' AND moderated_at IS NULL`, or every
rejection would return to the queue forever.

**No cofounder route takes a `:userId`.** The viewer posts about themselves and `/mine` is the only
addressing an owner gets.

### 6.8 Lane rate cards and the arrival window — **SHIPPED (Phase 20, `0106`–`0109`); admin reads added later, no migration**

Per A35's rule: a route that ships without a row here is invisible to the next reader, so the rows
land in the same change as the routes.

| Method | Route                                                      | Result                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards`                       | Create a lane card **with its bands and its volumetric divisor**; supersedes the incumbent. Idempotency-Key |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards/:rateCardId`           | `shorten_window` or `withdraw` — narrowing only. Idempotency-Key                                            |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards/:rateCardId/breaks`    | Append one band; refused once the card is in force. Idempotency-Key                                         |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards/:rateCardId/breaks`    | Replace the whole ordered set; same guard. Idempotency-Key                                                  |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/customs-dwell-estimates`                  | Record a dwell figure; closes the open-ended row on that scope. Idempotency-Key                             |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/admin/customs-dwell-estimates/:dwellEstimateId` | Retire it by closing its window. Idempotency-Key                                                            |
| GET    | `/commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards`                       | §19.10. Filters lane, `mode`, provider, `state`; rows are the write projection plus `bandsEditable`         |
| GET    | `/commerce/admin/customs-dwell-estimates`                  | §19.10. Same gate. `any` selects the NULL-scoped rows; `openOnly` narrows to open windows                   |
| GET    | `/commerce/orders/:orderId/arrival-window`                 | §19.4's projection. Optional `?mode=`; order membership required, `404` otherwise                           |

All six writes **and both admin reads** are gated on `moderate_commerce` **checked in-service**,
before any id or filter value is read, so neither the capability nor a card id is probeable from the
route table. Every write carries a required `Idempotency-Key` scoped to the **user**: a moderator acts
for the platform and may not belong to any commerce organization, and a retried create would supersede
the card the first attempt just minted. **The reads carry none** — a retried list changes nothing and
has no body to key on.

The reads landed after the phase, without a migration, and they are the reason four of the six writes
became callable at all: `PATCH /:rateCardId`, both `/breaks` verbs and
`PATCH /customs-dwell-estimates/:dwellEstimateId` each take an id no other route yielded. §19.10 is
the argument.

Freight prices on every one of these reads live inside `providerQuote`, and an unrateable lane
carries `quotableProviders` (§19.9b). Two existing reads were **extended, never replaced**:
`GET /store/products/:productSlug/delivery-estimate` keeps `data.estimates` byte-identical and adds a
sibling `data.lanePlan`; `checkout/prepare` keeps `deliveryEstimates` and adds `arrivalWindows`.

---

## 7. Boundary schemas and response rules

Controllers parse `params`, `query`, headers, and bodies with Zod `.strict()`. Unknown request keys
return `422`. Service input types are inferred from schemas.

Responses use canonical projections and stable tagged errors:

```ts
type CommerceResult<TValue, TError> =
    { success: true; value: TValue } | { success: false; error: TError };

type QuoteAcceptanceError =
    | { type: "NOT_FOUND" }
    | { type: "NOT_AUTHORIZED" }
    | { type: "QUOTE_EXPIRED"; expiredAt: Date }
    | { type: "REVISION_CHANGED"; currentRevision: number }
    | { type: "RFQ_NOT_OPEN" }
    | { type: "ORGANIZATION_NOT_ACTIVE" }
    | { type: "CONFLICTING_ACCEPTANCE"; orderId: string };
```

HTTP mapping:

- `400` malformed transport or unsupported multipart input
- `401` no session
- `403` authenticated but missing a non-probeable capability
- `404` missing or organization-scoped resource not visible to caller
- `409` valid request conflicts with current state/version/idempotency
- `422` schema or domain-field validation failure
- `429` rate limited
- `202` accepted asynchronous work, with a polling resource

List responses contain `{ items, page: { nextCursor, hasMore } }`. Every order ends with a unique
column, normally `id`, so cursor pagination cannot skip equal timestamps.

### 7.1 The error envelope's three fields

This was folklore until Phase 20 — 670 error messages followed it and nothing wrote it down, so a
refactor unified 12 of them onto a string that broke it and no test noticed.

**`message` is USER-FACING COPY, not a diagnostic.** Sentence case, ends with a period, second
person where it helps. It is frequently **the only thing a client renders** — 48 components display
it and only 2 also display `errors` — so it must stand alone and name an action rather than a
condition. `"Validation failed"` is the shape to avoid; `"Please check the highlighted fields."` and
`"This listing is not complete enough to publish."` are the shape to copy.

**Error-code tokens never reach the wire.** `NOT_FOUND`, `QUOTE_EXPIRED` and the rest are the `type`
discriminant of the tagged union above; the controller maps them to a sentence. No `message` is a
SCREAMING_SNAKE token, and none starts lowercase.

**`errors` is the only field-level channel — never `data`,** which is the success payload and which
clients do not read on a failure. Inside it, **`form` is reserved** for object-level issues:
`.strict()`'s `unrecognized_keys` is not attributable to any single field, and it is how every
rejected server-owned field arrives, so a responder that forwards only per-field entries answers
`422` with an empty object for precisely the hostile-payload case §0 exists for.

**One responder owns all of this**: `respondValidationFailed` in
`src/modules/rnd/projects/project-error-response.ts`, which delegates to the pure `buildValidationFailureBody`
so the envelope can be asserted as a value — pinned by `project-error-response.test.ts`. Controllers
either call the responder or wrap it; none rebuilds the body.

A domain error reshaped into the validation envelope — a 422 that names a field but is not a parse
failure — is built by **`fieldRefusal(field, reason)`**, which puts the same sentence in `message`
and in the `errors` entry. Only two client surfaces render `errors`, so a reason living solely there
reaches most screens as a bare "please check the fields" and names nothing; a reason living only in
`message` leaves those two unable to highlight the input. The helper exists so this is a function
call rather than a rule eleven call sites each had to remember — and it emits no `form` key, because
a domain refusal always knows which field it is about.

## 8. State transitions and concurrency

Every transition checks the current state in the write predicate or under a row lock.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  rfqDraft[RFQ draft] --> rfqOpen[open]
  rfqOpen --> rfqClosed[closed]
  rfqOpen --> rfqAwarded[awarded]
  quoteDraft[Quote draft] --> quoteSubmitted[submitted]

  orderPending --> orderConfirmed[confirmed]
  orderConfirmed --> orderFulfillment[in_fulfillment]
  orderFulfillment --> orderCompleted[completed]
```

- Two quote-acceptance requests cannot create two orders: unique accepted revision plus idempotency.
- Stock is reserved with row locking and bounded expiry.
- A provider cannot submit a revision after quote withdrawal/acceptance/expiry.
- Order totals are never recomputed from mutable listing data after creation.
- Shipment and service-engagement transitions append events; current state is a projection guarded
  by the transition service.

---

## 9. Search, merchandising, and caching

Search documents contain only public eligible fields. Product/category/provider mutations enqueue
refresh jobs after commit. Search may initially use PostgreSQL full-text/trigram indexes; an
external search engine is an adapter added only when measured scale requires it.

**A FILTER AND ITS COUNT ARE ONE QUERY (A39).** Both are built from `buildStoreSearchFilters` and
both read `store_search_document`. Written separately they will eventually disagree, and the
disagreement is invisible in review because each half is correct on its own — that is exactly how a
category page came to print a stock count its own cards contradicted.

**"Enqueue after commit" is the whole contract, and three writers had forgotten it.** Moderation
hide/restore, and the category-request verdict that reassigns listings, both changed a row the
document mirrors and enqueued nothing. `is_eligible` and `category_slug` are frozen copies: a writer
that changes what they mirror and does not enqueue leaves the catalog and search disagreeing, and
only the catalog looks right. `verify-store-phase-22-constraints` asserts the invariant rather than
the call sites, so the next writer to forget is caught by data rather than by review.

Home rails are server-defined:

- curated placements reference eligible entities and have start/end windows;
- algorithmic rails store a strategy key, not client-supplied item lists;
- personalized rails are private/no-store;
- public category/product pages may use bounded revalidation and tag invalidation;
- prices and stock shown during checkout are always fresh, regardless of browse cache.

Tailwind classes are never returned by the API. The API returns semantic presentation tokens such
as `accent: "amber"` from a closed enum; the frontend maps them to classes.

---

## 10. External providers and workers

External integrations follow an outbox/inbox model:

1. Validate and commit the local intent, idempotency key, and outbox event.
2. A worker calls the adapter.
3. Persist provider reference and normalized result.
4. Receive authenticated webhooks into an inbox table with unique provider event ID.
5. A worker applies the event exactly once and appends audit/journal records.

Adapters never return provider SDK objects to controllers. Secrets remain backend-only.

Scheduled jobs:

- expire quotes/RFQs and release inventory reservations;
- reconcile payment and transfer state;
- retry provider calls with bounded exponential backoff and dead-letter visibility;
- recompute public provider metrics and search documents;
- expire temporary document URLs, never source objects required for audit;
- re-check third-party embeds nightly (`revalidate-youtube-embeds`, 05:10 UTC). It reads TWO
  candidate sets since Phase 23 (A40) — the `video` table and `commerce_review_media` — on ONE
  cron, sharing one per-run oEmbed cache, one dead-letter queue and, critically, one outage rule:
  only "this video is gone" hides a row, "YouTube did not answer" hides nothing, and a run where
  YouTube answered nothing at all throws rather than reporting success.

---

## 11. Security and abuse controls

- Rate-limit search, organization creation, RFQ broadcast, message send, evidence upload, checkout,
  payment intent, dispute, report, and review endpoints with route-appropriate keys.
- Scan and normalize image/document uploads; allowlist file types by decoded content, not extension.
- Store private objects outside public buckets and issue short-lived authorized URLs.
- Normalize and allowlist external URLs before storage.
- Encrypt registration, tax, banking, and private contact fields.
- Sanctions/export-control/tax decisions are explicit backend services with versioned evidence.
- Prevent participant enumeration by returning `404` for inaccessible resource IDs.
- Moderate organization/provider/product public copy and retain decision history.
- Disallow self-review, reciprocal review abuse, and review before verified completion.
- Audit role changes, quote acceptance, order/payment transitions, refunds, dispute actions, and
  provider verification decisions.

---

## 12. Phased delivery

### Phase 0 — foundations

- Commerce organizations, memberships, addresses, verification evidence.
- Product organization-ownership and category migrations.
- Shared error, idempotency, audit, and document primitives.
- **Shipped** (expand/dual-write). Contract migration that makes ownership/category
  columns non-null remains gated by `docs/STORE_PHASE_0_ROLLOUT.md`.

### Phase 1 — real public store

- Public active-product projections, category tree, product detail, storefronts.
- Server-side search/filter/facets and curated merchandising.
- Remove fallback behavior that masks backend contract failures.
- **Shipped and hardened.** Moderator trade-state transitions, organization write
  rate limits, product specifications, category-subtree browse/search, and explicit
  home provider-directory failure mapping are included.

### Phase 2 — provider connector directory

- Provider profiles, kinds, typed offerings, coverage, moderation, public search/detail.
- Link eligible R&D suppliers to organizations without importing trust or project records.
- **Shipped** alongside Phase 1 in the Phase 1/2 rollout.

### Phase 3 — RFQ and quote negotiation

- Mixed product/service RFQs, invitations, threads, immutable quote revisions, comparison.
- Quote acceptance creates order snapshots.
- **Shipped.** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_3_ROLLOUT.md` for migrate, worker install, verification,
  and smoke tests. Cart/checkout remain Phase 4.

### Phase 4 — direct purchase and order operations

- Cart, inventory reservation, checkout groups, buyer and provider order queues.
- Product fulfillment and standalone service engagements.
- **Shipped.** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_4_ROLLOUT.md` for migrate, worker install, verification,
  and smoke tests. Payments and escrow remain Phase 5.

### Phase 5 — payments and trade assurance

- Commerce-specific payment/journal records, provider adapters, reconciliation, refunds.
- **Shipped (ledger + fake adapter).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_5_ROLLOUT.md` for migrate,
  worker install, verification, and smoke tests. Trade-assurance language and real payment
  processors remain blocked on legal/provider decisions (§14).
- **Its postings became rail-aware in Phase 24 (A41).** This phase wrote
  `buyer_clearing → order_held`; Phase 14 froze that pair onto a rail it had retired and did not
  revisit this service, so from Phase 14 until Phase 24 no payment could settle on any live rail.

### Phase 6 — connector execution

- Shipment legs and typed customs, insurance, inspection, lab, warehouse, marketing, and FX
  deliverables.
- Derived end-to-end progress without coupling connector state machines.
- **Shipped and hardened (command workflows + typed snapshots + contracted deliverable plans; no
  external provider adapters).** Migrations `0048`–`0051` close
  command idempotency, deterministic snapshot lineage, money/currency pairing, lifecycle
  reconciliation, payment-gated fulfillment, execution-contract provenance, and typed-read gaps.
  See `docs/STORE_PHASE_6_ROLLOUT.md` for migrate, verification, smoke flows, and rollback.
  Assurance language and live carrier/customs/insurance/lab/FX connectors remain blocked
  on legal/provider decisions (§14).

### Phase 7 — trust and optimization

- **Trust MVP shipped and hardened (`0052`–`0053`):** verified reviews, disputes,
  server-issued completions, privacy-safe provider/product metrics, database-bound trust
  relationships, and fulfillment freezes while an order is disputed. See
  `docs/STORE_PHASE_7_ROLLOUT.md`.
- Still deferred: Q&A, content reports, ranking, recommendations, abuse-operations automation,
  and trade-assurance financial remedies.

### Phase 8 — catalog depth and the relation graph

- Product variants (A1), media kinds (A2), specification grouping (A3), `condition` in the public
  projection (A4), packaging dimensions and weight (A5), highlights (A6).
- `commerce_product_relation` (§15.3), which unblocks similar / frequently-bought / compare (A7).
- The merchandising integrity fixes in A19.
- **Shipped and hardened (`0054`–`0056`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_8_ROLLOUT.md`. A1 was indeed the
  expensive one: a variant reaches the tier ladder, the gallery, the cart, the inventory
  reservation, the checkout prepare snapshot and the order line, and the rule that makes it safe —
  a product with active variants refuses a line that names none — is enforced in
  `commerce-pricing.ts` and again by database triggers.

### Phase 9 — guided pathways

- Slots, candidates, anchors and pathway images (§15.2), set pricing (§15.4), authoring and
  moderation (§15.5), degradation signals (§15.6), the derivation job (§15.9).
- **Shipped and hardened (`0057`–`0058`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_9_ROLLOUT.md`. Three things
  the specification did not anticipate turned out to be load-bearing. A slot candidate carries a
  `variantId`, because A1's rule refuses a cart line naming no variant and a candidate without
  one would be a piece the set advertises and cannot sell. Derived candidates are computed at
  read time and never stored, because a stored copy is stale the moment a seller edits the graph.
  And the authoring surface serves two principals through one route set — a seller with an
  organization and a merchandiser with none — which is why idempotency there is user-scoped.

### Phase 10 — the public voice

- Review reads, media, sub-scores, helpful votes and seller replies (A8); Q&A (A9); content reports
  (A12); engagement counters (A11); product-scoped threads (A14).
- **Shipped (`0064`–`0068`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_10_ROLLOUT.md`. Four things the
  specification did not anticipate turned out to be load-bearing. **A12's premise was wrong** —
  commerce reports cannot feed `content_review_action`, whose `video_id` is NOT NULL, so a parallel
  `commerce_moderation_action` ships instead. **A14 could not key its thread on the product**:
  `commerce_thread_resource_uidx` would have collapsed every buyer into one thread per product, so
  a `commerce_product_inquiry` row became the resource the thread points at. **A11 is user-scoped,
  not organization-scoped**, because `tradeState` starts `pending` and an org-keyed bookmark would
  sit behind staff verification. And **an automatic moderation hide cannot enter the platform audit
  chain**, whose `actorUserId` is NOT NULL, which is why `commerce_moderation_action.actionSource`
  exists.
- A10 (product comments) remains deliberately out: the appendix requires a product decision first.

### Phase 11 — buyer logistics

- A `delivery` address kind and a shippable order address (A15) — the only entry in the appendix that
  was a correctness problem rather than a missing feature.
- Indicative delivery estimates from provider coverage (A16), sample ordering (A17), seller-declared
  customization options (A18).
- **Shipped and hardened (`0059`–`0062`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_11_ROLLOUT.md`. Three things
  worth carrying forward. The reveal route is the only place this backend hands one organization
  another's PII, and its audit entry is written to the BUYER's stream — if it cannot be written the
  read rolls back, because an unlogged reveal defeats the reason a decrypt path was chosen over an
  openable snapshot. The delivery estimate never reaches money: `shippingInCents` stays `0` and an
  uncovered route returns an empty list rather than a zero. And landing on this code uncovered a
  live bug — `createAddress`'s audit payload used the key `addressKind`, which the PII-name guard
  matched, so address creation had been failing at runtime for every caller.

### Phase 12 — seller profile depth

- `commerce_seller_profile`, organization media, site access, stakeholders and capabilities
  (A13 items 2–5).
- `commerce_organization_certification` with a moderated review lifecycle (A13 item 6) —
  **not** a `certification` kind on `commerce_organization_verification`, whose pending
  unique index allows one pending row per kind and which has no name, issuer or expiry
  column.
- The promised-delivery chain and the three derived metrics (A13 items 1 and 7), closing the
  last entry in Appendix A that reached the wire and could never carry a value.
- **Shipped and hardened (`0069`–`0072`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_12_ROLLOUT.md`. Four things
  worth carrying forward. **The promise must be fixed where the order is created** — a
  seller-typed date at ship time would let the metric grade itself, and re-reading the
  product at confirm would hold a seller to a lead time the buyer never saw; it therefore
  rides product → prepare line → order line, because `confirmCheckout` builds an order line
  verbatim from the prepare row. **Expiry is not a state**: lapsing is a `current_date`
  comparison at read time, where a stored `expired` value would need a job to flip it and
  would be wrong between ticks. **Every rate is `null` below its sample threshold and ships
  its sample size**, and the thresholds stay off the wire. And **reusing the
  verification-evidence upload middleware was wrong** — it caps multer at two text fields and
  a certification sends six, so every submission returned a flat 422 until it got its own
  parser. Only the HTTP smoke could have found that.

### Phase 13 — ranking, trending and recommendations

- The anti-fraud trending and ranking engine specified in
  [`STORE_TRENDING_SPEC_V2_2.md`](STORE_TRENDING_SPEC_V2_2.md): a product view beacon,
  qualified-order velocity, demand-anchored freshness, hierarchical category priors, subnet
  concentration, refund and cancellation penalties, an observe-only circuit breaker, and the
  `trending` / `recommended` rail strategies that replace `trending_placeholder`.
- **Shipped and hardened (`0073`-`0081`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_13_ROLLOUT.md`. Four things
  worth carrying forward. **The store observed no views at all** — saves, bookmarks and shares
  were counted and attention was not, so a conversion rate had no denominator and two of the
  specification's ten refinements had no input; the beacon is the largest new surface in the
  phase and everything else could have been built without it. **The share counter was a live
  hole**: anonymous callers incremented it with no dedup of any kind, harmless only while
  nothing read it, which is exactly what this phase changed — so it was fixed before the
  signal was wired, not after. **`commerce_order` had no durable lifecycle instant**: the
  audit stream never records the payment-settled transition and records nothing at all for
  the reconciliation-driven ones, so `confirmed_at` had to be added rather than derived, and
  nothing is backfilled because the only candidate source was a mutable `updated_at`. And
  **the subnet penalty carries a floor the specification did not ask for**, because one
  procurement team behind one office NAT is indistinguishable from a click farm on the
  evidence this schema holds — on the seeded fixtures they read 0.98 and 0.91.

### Phase 14 — external settlement, document scanning, and the legacy cleanup

- **§14's custody question, decided and built.** Qatoto provides no escrow and never holds
  funds. Escrow is a term the two parties negotiate in their own thread and opt into
  together, held by a licensed third party reached through a connector; the default rail is
  direct settlement with no protection at all, which is what most B2B trade at this size
  actually does.
- The shared external-connector substrate — provider registry, command outbox, event inbox,
  the first inbound webhook route in this backend and the raw-body mount it needs — plus the
  external escrow adapter, negotiated settlement agreements, and a rail-aware ledger whose
  gross value is off balance sheet.
- **14b** supplies the malware scanner A18 was missing, without which a product carrying a
  required upload slot could not be checked out by anybody. **14c** adds the four remaining
  §3 adapter seams. **14d** retires `product.seller_id` and the dead `store_pathway_item`.
- **Shipped and hardened (`0082`–`0089`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_14_ROLLOUT.md`. Five things
  the specification did not anticipate. **`ensureCommerceJournalAccounts` was a live
  blocker** — it created all six legacy accounts unconditionally, which the new rail guard
  rejects, so every escrow order would have failed at its first posting. **A successful
  checkout could return 500**, because the post-commit dispatch enqueue threw rather than
  returning a failed `Result`, telling a buyer to retry an order that had been placed.
  **`seller_payable` is now asserted to stay unposted**, so wiring it later fails the build
  and forces the conversation. **Migration `0088` created a duplicate index** that `0089`
  removes, `0088` being left as applied because drizzle hashes migrations. And **the commerce
  foundation verifier was silently wrong**, hidden behind the missing-column error the
  `seller_id` drop exposed — 14 of 17 products read as mismatched and all 14 were correct.

### Phase 15 — closing Appendix A

- **Every remaining buildable entry in the register**, and three of them were defects in
  shipped features rather than missing ones: a required customization option made a
  product uncheckoutable by anybody (A23), `documentIds` was a field no route could fill
  (A30), and a dispute had no reader but platform staff (A28).
- Also: helpful votes on answers and per-viewer vote state on both public reads (A24); a
  supplier directory plus the filters matching the facets the platform already publishes,
  and a category ancestor trail (A25); per-tier lead time and thread attachments (A27);
  and the cross-order logistics queue (A29).
- **Shipped and hardened (`0093`–`0097`).** See `docs/STORE_PHASE_15_ROLLOUT.md`. Five
  things the specification did not anticipate. **`updateOrganization` refreshed search
  only on a visibility change**, which was right while an organization was just an
  eligibility flag on its products and would have left the new supplier directory
  advertising a renamed company's old name indefinitely. **`assertOwnedDocuments` never
  checked document state**, harmless only while the ids were unfillable. **The search
  backfill covered products and offerings only**, and organizations have to run last
  because a supplier's search text is built from its own product documents. **A29's ETA
  is not on the shipment** — it is on the leg, which forced an `EXISTS` and a `max()`
  rollup. And **the smoke script's first run 403'd everywhere** because it never
  activated an organization, which the Phase 14 smoke already documents.

### Phase 16 — store taxonomy administration

- **The browse tree finally got an author.** `commerce_category` shipped in Phase 0 with public
  reads, a unique sibling-order index and a seed script, and no write surface of any kind — so
  the hierarchy every buyer navigates was editable only by hand in psql, and a seller whose
  product fitted no existing category had nowhere to say so. §6.5's ten routes and
  `commerce_category_request` close both halves.
- Create with an image, rename, re-parent, reorder a whole sibling set in one call, retire
  reversibly; plus the seller request queue and its terminal verdict. See §4.3a.
- **Shipped (`0098`).** Two things the specification did not anticipate, both of which changed
  the shape rather than the scope. **The `moderate_commerce` check moved into the service**, so a
  refusal returns a `Result` that joins the controller's exhaustive error switch and can be
  proven to run before any id is read — a middleware cannot do either, and a route that reads an
  id before authorizing is an id oracle (§11). And **`productAssignments[]` had to appear on both
  arms of the verdict, not just the approve arm**: a rejection still has to put the waiting
  listings somewhere, and a moderator reading the request frequently finds one of them belongs in
  a category that already exists. That is also what turned `waitingProducts` from a count into a
  list of titles.
- **The first store phase whose frontend shipped wired rather than mocked** — all ten calls in
  `src/lib/store/admin-categories.api.ts` use the real transport. Appendix A31 records it as
  shipped for exactly that reason.

### Phase 17 — manufacturer directory — **SHIPPED (`0099`–`0101`)**

- `/store/factories` and its detail read, built as a **projection over Phase 12's seller profile**
  and A25's organization search document rather than a parallel table set (§16). The directory
  substrate is `store_search_document` where `documentKind = 'organization' AND isEligible`, inner
  joined to `commerce_seller_profile` and narrowed to `businessType IN ('manufacturer',
'manufacturer_trading')` — a trading company is not a factory.
- The three conflicts of §16.2 were resolved first, and all three decisions are recorded:
  **the capability enum widened additively** (`0099`), **a nullable `standardCode`** over a seeded
  eight-value enum beside the free-text certification name (`0100`), and **`site_audited` was given
  the record it had been asserting without** — `commerce_organization_site_audit`, staff-written,
  carrying a NOT NULL `audit_entry_id`. It is never derived from a document review.
- Genuinely new: `commerce_organization_production_line`, `commerce_organization_site`, the audit
  pair, and nine columns on `commerce_seller_profile` for sample policy, order bounds and the
  inbox switch. **`exportMarkets` is DERIVED**, not declared: distinct delivery-address country
  codes over completed orders where the factory is the counterparty. Empty is a fact.
- `commerce_manufacturing_inquiry` with the `sent`, `answered` and `closed` transitions, the
  `/mine` and `/received` reads without which a create is a write into a hole, and its own
  one-to-one thread through the `manufacturing_inquiry` resource kind (§16.5).
- **One wire addition beyond the frontend's contract:** the detail read carries
  `otherCertifications[]` for approved certificates whose standard is outside the closed eight.
  `certificationRecords[]` cannot hold them — its `certification` field is a closed enum — and
  dropping them would mean the platform silently refusing to show a valid certificate.

### Phase 18 — business forum — **SHIPPED (`0102`–`0103`)**

- `community_forum_thread`, its replies and their helpful votes, modelled on
  `research_program_post` (§17.2).
- **The reply, accept-answer and helpful writes shipped with the thread create, not after it.** A
  forum with only thread-create is a wall of unanswerable questions (§17.3).
- `pending_review` on create, the moderation queue behind it, and `community_content_report` on
  the existing `moderate_content` capability — which is what keeps A10 closed while a public text
  surface exists at all (§17.1, §17.4).
- **The vote is keyed on the USER, not an organization**, which is the one place it departs from
  `commerce_product_answer_vote`: a forum has no members, only authors, and keying on the
  organization would exclude every individual poster.
- **The queue predicate is `state = 'pending_review' AND moderated_at IS NULL`.** A rejected thread
  stays `pending_review` — that is what keeps it out of every public read while leaving it
  readable on `/mine` with its reason — so filtering on state alone would return every rejection
  to the queue forever.

### Phase 19 — cofounder directory — **SHIPPED (`0104`–`0105`), without the capital figures**

- **§14 is still open, and the build respects it literally rather than waiting on it.** The full
  surface ships — the directory, the detail read, and the seven lifecycle routes the frontend
  contract omitted — and **no capital or equity column exists**. `capitalRange` and
  `equityExpectationBasisPoints` are already `.nullable()` on the wire and serve `null`.
  A stored figure withheld by a projection is one careless edit from being published; an absent
  column cannot be. `verify-store-phase-19-constraints` asserts that absence as its first check.
- `community_cofounder_profile`, prior ventures, and the three tag tables in
  `talent_profile_skill`'s shape — **`talent_profile` itself is deliberately not extended**, since
  the R&D talent directory reads it and a cofounder row there is a different claim about a
  different person's intent.
- The four rules in §18.1 are enforced server-side. No `sort` parameter exists on the directory
  read, `not_looking` profiles stay in the list, and `identityState` derives from
  `isIdentifiedUser` — the predicate `requireIdentifiedUser` already enforces, extracted rather
  than duplicated, so there is one definition of "identified" on this platform (§18.4).
- **The write schema refuses a capital field with 422 rather than discarding it.** Silently
  dropping a number somebody typed about themselves would let them believe it was recorded.

### Phase 20 — lane rate cards and the arrival window — **SHIPPED (`0106`–`0109`)**

The last store surface with a named backend gap in front of it. Specified in full at §19, and built:

- `commerce_freight_rate_card` and `commerce_freight_rate_break` — the lane price lists nobody has
  bought yet, with transit days on the **break** rather than the card;
- `commerce_customs_dwell_estimate` — the second missing input, which §14's rate-card entry did not
  name;
- the arrival-window projection on the order and on `checkout/prepare`, which is what makes a
  delivery **window** expressible without making a delivery **date** a promise;
- the extension of `GET /store/products/:productSlug/delivery-estimate` into per-leg, per-mode
  options.

`sheets/delivery-sheet.tsx` was the one store component held at `TRANSPORT: mock` against this
phase. Every contract it needs now exists; the tables behind them are empty until a forwarder tariff
is purchased and loaded, so the sheet renders named absences rather than mock floats.

Beyond the specification, this phase also added `lead_time_min_days_snapshot` to the prepare and
order lines (`0108`) — §19.4 reports manufacturing as a RANGE, and only the maximum had ever been
snapshotted. Nothing is backfilled: an order placed before the column existed reports `daysMin: null`
and says so.

Each phase ships backend contracts before its frontend controls are presented as functional.

---

## 13. Verification and release gates

Before a phase is called wired:

- migrations apply to a production-like snapshot and rollback strategy is documented;
- backfill counts and orphan/constraint checks pass;
- TypeScript, formatting, lint, and build pass in the backend;
- public reads cannot expose draft/suspended/private fields;
- organization membership and cross-tenant probes fail correctly;
- duplicate idempotency calls return one business result;
- quote/order/payment state races preserve one legal transition;
- cursor pagination is deterministic;
- money remains integer cents and each amount has an explicit currency;
- webhook replay is harmless;
- audit/journal entries reconcile with domain transitions;
- frontend response schemas parse every documented response and reject malformed fixtures.

Tests are implemented only when separately requested; this document defines the acceptance
conditions and contract.

---

## 14. Explicitly deferred decisions

The following require legal, provider, or product decisions before implementation:

- countries and industries Qatoto may serve;
- **whether Qatoto may publish self-declared capital ranges and equity expectations, and in which
  jurisdictions.** §18's directory lists people looking for a cofounder, and the frontend's proposed
  card carries both a stated capital range and an `equityExpectationBasisPoints`. A platform that
  publishes "this person has $2–5M and wants 15%" beside a contact affordance is close to
  facilitating a securities solicitation, and "close to" is decided by a lawyer per market, not by a
  schema. §18.1's four rules are the shape the surface takes **if** it ships — self-reported and
  labelled as such, no ranking that reads as a recommendation, an ask rather than an allocation, and
  an identity check that is explicitly not a claims check. Whether it may ship at all is separate.
  **Until decided, the backend stores no capital figure it would then have to publish.** Note this is
  a stricter posture than the revenue-disclosure decision below, and deliberately: a seller consenting
  to publish its own trading volume is disclosing a fact about a business, while a person publishing
  what they will invest is advertising an intent to deploy capital.
  **Phase 19 shipped the rest of §18 against this rule rather than waiting on it.** The directory,
  the detail read and the full lifecycle are live; `community_cofounder_profile` has **no
  `capital_range_*`, no `currency` and no `equity_expectation_basis_points` column**, both wire
  fields serve `null`, and the create schema answers **422** for either rather than accepting and
  discarding it. `scripts/verify-store-phase-19-constraints.ts` asserts the absence as its first
  check, so adding one of those columns before this decision lands fails a verifier by name.
  **What landing it costs:** one additive migration, the four columns, a `CHECK` that the capital
  triple is all-null or all-set, and replacing the `UNDECIDED_CAPITAL_DISCLOSURE` constant in
  `community-cofounder.service.ts` with a column read. Nothing else on the surface changes;

- ~~merchant-of-record and custody model;~~ **DECIDED: Qatoto is not a custodian.** It never
  holds funds. Buyer and seller either settle directly and carry the counterparty risk, or
  they agree between themselves on a licensed third-party escrow provider reached through a
  connector. The alternative — first-party custody, which is what Alibaba's Trade Assurance
  does — was not chosen: it puts Qatoto inside money-transmitter and escrow licensing in
  every jurisdiction it operates in, and the ledger would then have to assert a custody that
  §0's own posture makes it answerable for. **Built in Phase 14.** Note that the merchant of
  record on the `direct_processor` rail is the SELLER, which is why that rail settles to the
  seller's account with an application fee rather than through Qatoto.
- supported payment methods and refund authority;
- Incoterms, tax, tariff, and sanctions providers;
- legally valid e-signature and purchase-order requirements;
- insurance solicitation/licensing boundaries;
- FX facilitator licensing and whether Qatoto ever touches funds;
- service-level guarantees and assurance coverage;
- retention periods for invoices, customs records, lab reports, and disputes;
- ~~**whether a supplier's trading volume or revenue may be published, and on what consent.**~~
  **DECIDED: publishable, but only on explicit seller consent and only as a gated tier.** The figure
  is derivable from settled order data; the aggregation was never the hard part. What was missing is
  a consent record, so a seller elects the disclosure and may withdraw it. This is Alibaba's shape —
  it publishes "Online revenue" and "Transactions in the last 6 months" as a benefit of paid Gold
  Supplier membership, so the seller both consents to and pays for the exposure. Amazon publishes
  nothing about seller revenue at all. The alternative — deriving and publishing it because the data
  exists — was not chosen: a competitor reading a supplier's revenue off its own storefront is a
  disclosure the platform made on the seller's behalf.
  **The open design question this creates, and it is real.** A13's rule is that a derived stat and a
  declared stat must be visibly different on the wire, which is why the storefront carries
  `declaredProfile` and `measuredMetrics` and nothing else. A consented revenue figure is
  **platform-measured AND seller-gated**, which is neither of those two shapes: putting it under
  `measuredMetrics` hides the consent, and putting it under `declaredProfile` calls a platform
  aggregate a seller's assertion. It therefore needs its own member — `consentedDisclosures`, absent
  entirely rather than `null` when consent has not been given — plus a
  `commerce_seller_profile.revenue_disclosure_consented_at` and the withdrawal path that makes
  consent meaningful. Not built.
- **DECIDED: a buyer organization is auto-provisioned, not waited for.** A15's address cap and
  `delivery` kind assume an organization exists, and §4.11 derives thread participants and order
  parties from memberships, so addresses and carts cannot go user-scoped the way A11's engagement
  counters did. But `commerce_organization.tradeState` starts `pending` and only a staff decision
  makes it `active`, which put a buyer's first saved address behind human verification. Decision: on
  a buyer's first action that needs one, create a pending `commerce_organization` with the caller as
  `owner`, and let address CRUD and cart operate inside it. Trust gates stay exactly where they
  earn something — `checkout/confirm`, RFQ broadcast, seller listing, provider offerings — rather
  than in front of a single tap.
  **This is NOT what Alibaba does, and the earlier claim that it was should not be cited.** On
  Alibaba a buyer IS a user account; the organization-shaped entity exists only on the supplier
  side, where it is verified. Qatoto mints a shell because §4.11 derives thread participants and
  order parties from memberships, so a buyer with no organization has no addressable identity —
  which is what the two sentences above already say. The shell is the price of that earlier
  modelling choice, not an imitation of anybody. What Alibaba's signup does support is the
  narrower point that **a buyer should not wait on human review to browse, message and fill a
  cart**, and that is the part this decision keeps.
  **Consequence for A14:**
  `contactAffordance` keeps all three values, but `ask_question` stops being the common case for a
  signed-in visitor, because a signed-in visitor now has an organization.
  **BUILT in Phase 21 (`0110`–`0111`).** `requireProvisionedBuyerCommerceWorkspace` mints the shell
  on the taps in front of the gates; all four named gates are unchanged, and the two in-transaction
  checks behind them — `assertOrganizationActive` in the checkout service and the trade-state read
  inside `openRfq` — were deliberately left strict. Two things §14 did not anticipate are recorded
  in **Appendix A37**: the shell has no country to declare, and a pending row minted by the server
  is indistinguishable from a pending row somebody applied with.
- **DECIDED: lane rate cards are funded, and they are an input, not a booking.** A16 chose a
  coverage-derived estimate with no date and no money and recorded `shippingInCents: 0` as the
  decision rather than the gap; that stands. What is funded is the missing input —
  origin/destination lane, mode, weight and volume breaks, validity window and source forwarder —
  so `sheets/delivery-sheet.tsx`'s per-leg mode picker has prices behind it instead of the
  hardcoded floats it sums today. Alibaba computes browse-time freight this way, from cards it buys
  from forwarders. Amazon can promise a delivery DATE only because it owns the network, and Qatoto
  owns neither, so A16's two rules carry across unchanged: **a rate card produces a range with its
  provenance and never a date**, and an uncovered lane returns an empty array, never a zero.
  Rating from a card still never writes `shippingInCents` — nothing is charged for freight until
  something is booked. **Specified in §19**, which also adds the second missing input this entry
  did not name — customs dwell — and the arrival-window projection the two of them make
  expressible. **BUILT in Phase 20 (`0106`–`0109`); §19 is now a record.** The remaining
  dependency is commercial rather than technical: the tables are empty until a forwarder lane
  list is bought.
- ~~**the volumetric divisor, and therefore chargeable weight.**~~ **DECIDED: the divisor is a
  required column on the rate card (`0109`).** It varies by forwarder as well as by mode, so no
  platform constant could be correct for everyone; requiring it means the forwarder's own convention
  rides with their tariff and the platform never picks one. See §19.9.
- ~~**how a seller obtains a buyer's full delivery address.**~~ **DECIDED: an authorized decrypt
  path.** A seller organization with an active order fetches the buyer's decrypted street lines,
  recipient name and phone through a server route that authorizes the caller against that specific
  order, rate-limits, and writes an audit entry per read. The alternative — a seller-openable
  encrypted snapshot — was not chosen: it would put ciphertext a seller can decrypt at rest
  indefinitely, with no record of when it was opened, whereas a decrypt path makes every access an
  auditable event and revocable by closing the order. The order snapshot keeps its redacted
  plaintext columns for display; the decrypt path is the only route to the rest. **Built in
  Phase 11** as `GET /commerce/orders/:orderId/delivery-address` (Appendix A15).

Until decided, the backend stores no fabricated guarantee and the frontend displays no claim that
money, shipment, certification, insurance, or compliance is assured.

**One frontend surface already violates this and is knowingly held back.**
`sections/trade-protection.tsx` and `sheets/trade-protection-sheet.tsx` render four finished
guarantees — "funds are only released once the order is confirmed", "full refund — no back-and-forth
with the seller". That copy is mock and stays behind this decision (Appendix A20); it is not
scheduled work, and no backend entry exists to make it true.

## 15. Guided pathways — the buy-the-set surface

> **Status: built (Phase 9, migrations `0057`–`0058`).** §15.3's `commerce_product_relation`
> shipped in Phase 8; `store_pathway_slot` and `store_pathway_slot_candidate` shipped in Phase 9,
> along with anchors, pathway images, read-time set pricing, degradation signals, authoring and
> moderation, cart seeding and the derivation job. `store_pathway_item` is backfilled, deprecated
> and no longer read; a later migration drops it. Where the implementation departs from the text
> below, the departure is noted inline and explained in `docs/STORE_PHASE_9_ROLLOUT.md`.

### 15.1 A pathway is a composition, not a rail

A rail ranks products that happen to be good; the buyer picks one. A **pathway** is a set whose
members relate to each other, and the buyer's intent is the whole thing:

- pick an outfit and get the jewelry, trousers, shirt and boots that go together;
- pick a bicycle and get the matching jersey, gearset, lights and the bolts that actually fit it.

In this market that reads as **multi-SKU kit sourcing** — "everything to fit out a hotel room",
"everything to assemble 500 bicycles" — which is the thing single-SKU search is worst at. A buyer
who knows the kit but not the part numbers cannot express that as a query, and today has to run one
search per line.

Two shapes, one model, distinguished by a nullable `anchorProductId`:

| Shape            | `anchorProductId` | Slots come from               | Example                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Curated set**  | `NULL`            | hand-picked by a merchandiser | "Autumn hotel-room refit"            |
| **Anchored set** | a product         | the relation graph (§15.3)    | "Everything for the Model-C bicycle" |

They share one route, one wire shape, and one renderer. An anchored set is not a second feature; it
is a pathway whose slots were resolved rather than typed.

### 15.2 Slots, not items

Before Phase 9, `store_pathway_item` was `(pathwayId, entityKind, entityId, position)` with an **untyped,
un-FK'd `entityId`**. Three things followed from that, and all three were wrong for a set:

1. **A dead member vanished silently.** `resolveEligibleMerchandisingItems` drops any id that is no
   longer publicly eligible, so a five-piece look rendered as three pieces with nothing saying a
   piece was missing. For a rail that is correct — a shorter rail is still a rail. For a set it is a
   lie: the buyer believes they are seeing the whole kit.
2. **Pathway items were the only merchandising rows with no time window.** `store_rail_placement`
   has carried `startsAt`/`endsAt` since Phase 1; items carried neither until A19, so a seasonal
   member could not be scheduled in or out.
3. **`getPathwayBySlug` returned every item, unbounded** — no limit, no cursor. A 200-piece kit was
   one response.

It was replaced by two tables.

`store_pathway_slot` — a **role** in the set, not a product:

- `id`, `pathwayId`
- `roleLabel` — "Footwear", "Front light", "Chain bolts". Display copy, not an enum: the roles in a
  hotel refit and a bicycle build share nothing.
- `isRequired` — a required slot with no eligible candidate makes the set incomplete (§15.6)
- `quantity` — how many units of the chosen candidate the set needs. A bicycle takes one saddle and
  twelve bolts.
- `siblingOrder`, `startsAt`, `endsAt`, timestamps
- unique `(pathwayId, siblingOrder)`

`store_pathway_slot_candidate` — the products that can fill a slot:

- `id`, `slotId`, `productId` **with a real foreign key**
- `variantId` — **added in Phase 9, not in the original text.** A1's rule refuses a cart line
  naming no variant for a product that has active variants, so a candidate without one would be
  a piece the set advertises and cannot sell. A database trigger binds the variant to its own
  product and requires it to be active.
- `rank` — 0 is the default the set shows first
- `sourceKind` — `curated | derived` (§15.3), so a swap suggested by the graph is distinguishable
  from one a merchandiser chose. **Only `curated` rows are stored**: derived candidates are
  resolved from the relation graph at read time, because a stored copy would be stale the moment
  a seller edits the graph.
- unique `(slotId, productId, coalesce(variantId, ''))` — one product in two variants is two
  legitimate candidates for the same role, the expression-index shape `0054`/`0055` established

**Why candidates rather than one product per slot.** It is what makes a swap possible ("show me a
cheaper saddle"), and it is what turns today's silent shrink into a fall-through: when rank 0 is out
of stock the slot offers rank 1 instead of disappearing. A set is only as robust as its substitutes.

`store_pathway` gains `anchorProductId` (nullable FK), `heroImageUrl` and `cardImageUrl`. It has no
image column at all today, which is why the frontend renders a local placeholder banner
(`mockPathwayBannerForSlug`) — that function deletes itself the day these columns land.

### 15.3 The product relation graph

**Built in Phase 8 (Appendix A7).** Before it, no table in this schema had two foreign keys to
`product` — no similar-product edge, no accessory edge, no spare-part edge, no compatibility edge —
and every discovery feature the frontend mocks ("Frequently bought together", "Other
recommendations", "View similar", "Add to Compare") plus every anchored pathway was blocked on the
same missing thing. The shape as built:

`commerce_product_relation`

- `id`, `fromProductId`, `toProductId` — both FK to `product`, both `restrict`
- `relationKind`:
  `accessory_of | spare_part_of | consumable_for | compatible_with | complements | replaces`
- `sourceKind`: `seller_declared | moderator_curated | derived_cooccurrence`
- `rank`, `createdByUserId`, timestamps
- unique `(fromProductId, toProductId, relationKind)`; CHECK `fromProductId <> toProductId`

Directional on purpose. "This bolt is a spare part of that bicycle" does not invert into "that
bicycle is a spare part of this bolt". Symmetric meanings (`complements`, `compatible_with`) are
stored as two rows so a single query direction serves every read.

> **The rule that governs this table.** A seller saying its bolt fits a given bicycle is a **claim**,
> not a fact — the same posture §0 takes on prices, badges and countries. A `seller_declared`
> relation may drive discovery; it may **never** be projected as verified compatibility. `sourceKind`
> rides the wire so no client can render a claim as a check mark, and only `moderator_curated`
> earns confirmatory language. Fitment is a safety claim in every category where it matters —
> brake parts, electrical, load-bearing hardware — and getting this wrong is not a merchandising bug.

One table, five surfaces: anchored pathway slots, similar products, frequently-bought-together,
compare candidates, and spare-part lookup from an order line.

### 15.4 Set pricing is computed, never stored

The set CTA reads "Buy complete set · N items", which implies a total. That total is **derived at
read time** from current pricing tiers, per currency, exactly as `/commerce/cart` already prices a
cart — §0's rule that the client may display a price but never establish one applies unchanged, and
a stored set total would be stale the moment a seller edits a tier.

A pathway spanning several sellers is not a new order type. It **seeds a cart**; the existing
cart → `checkout/prepare` → `checkout/confirm` path then produces one `commerce_order` per
counterparty (§2.3). Nothing about a pathway reaches an order — the order's line snapshots record
products, quantities and prices, and a set is a browsing construct, not a commercial one.

`POST /commerce/cart/from-pathway/:pathwaySlug` adds one chosen candidate per required slot at its
slot quantity, returns the authoritative cart, and reports any slot it could not fill rather than
quietly adding fewer lines.

### 15.5 Authorship and moderation

Platform merchandisers curate directly. A seller may **propose** a set through the same
`draft → pending_review → active` flow `commerce_service_offering` already uses, because a seller
knows its own compatibility better than a merchandiser does.

Moderation is not ceremony here: without it, a seller composes a set entirely from its own SKUs and
a curated look becomes an advertisement. A reviewer checks that slots are filled on merit and that
`seller_declared` compatibility claims in a safety-relevant category have evidence behind them.

### 15.6 Honest degradation

A set that cannot be completed must say so. The projection carries:

- per slot — `state`: `available | substituted | unavailable`, and which candidate was chosen;
- per pathway — `requiredSlotCount`, `filledRequiredSlotCount`, `isComplete`.

The frontend can then render "3 of 5 pieces available" and disable the whole-set CTA, instead of
showing a shorter set that looks complete. **Never omit an unfillable required slot from the
response** — an absent slot and a slot with nothing in it are different facts, and only the second
one is true.

### 15.7 Public API

| Method | Route                                     | Purpose                                                                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/store/pathways`                         | Active pathways with `cardImageUrl`; cursor-paginated                                      |
| GET    | `/store/pathways/:pathwaySlug`            | Slots, ranked candidates, per-currency set totals, completeness; cursor over slots         |
| GET    | `/store/products/:productSlug/companions` | Relation-graph companions for a PDP, grouped by `relationKind`, each carrying `sourceKind` |

`GET /store/pathways/:pathwaySlug` replaced the unbounded flat `items` array. Set totals are an
array keyed by currency — a kit sourced from three countries has three totals and no single number,
and inventing one would mean converting currencies without an FX quote.

### 15.8 Authoring API

| Method | Route                                                    | Result                                               |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/commerce/pathways`                                     | Create draft (merchandiser, or seller proposal)      |
| PATCH  | `/commerce/pathways/:pathwayId`                          | Update owned draft                                   |
| PUT    | `/commerce/pathways/:pathwayId/slots`                    | Replace the slot plan                                |
| PUT    | `/commerce/pathways/:pathwayId/slots/:slotId/candidates` | Replace ranked candidates                            |
| POST   | `/commerce/pathways/:pathwayId/submit`                   | Submit for moderation                                |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/pathways/:pathwayId/moderate`           | Publish or reject                                    |
| PUT    | `/commerce/products/:productId/relations`                | Seller declares relations — always `seller_declared` |
| POST   | `/commerce/admin/product-relations/:relationId/verify`   | Promote to `moderator_curated`                       |

All writes take `Idempotency-Key` and are organization-scoped like every other commerce write.

The last two rows shipped in Phase 8; everything above them shipped in Phase 9. The verify route is
scoped to the user rather than an organization, because a moderator acts for the platform and may
not belong to a commerce organization at all.

Two routes exist that this table does not list, and both exist because without them the ones it
does list are unreachable: `GET /commerce/pathways/mine` (an author cannot edit a draft it cannot
find) and `GET /commerce/admin/pathways` (a reviewer would have to be handed an id out of band,
which is how a review step quietly stops happening). The queue projection carries
`ownCandidateShare` — §15.5's self-dealing signal, surfaced for a reviewer rather than
auto-rejected, because a bicycle maker legitimately supplies most of a bicycle kit.

Every write here takes `Idempotency-Key`, scoped to the **user** rather than the active
organization: the organization scope refuses a caller who has none, which would lock out exactly
the platform merchandiser §15.5 grants this surface to.

### 15.9 Derivation job

`derive-product-relations` — **shipped in Phase 9.** Nightly at 02:40 UTC through a tick queue, in
the pattern of the other store jobs: mines co-occurrence from completed order lines into
`derived_cooccurrence` relations with a rank, never overwriting a `moderator_curated` or
`seller_declared` row. Because the unique index is `(from, to, relationKind)` and carries no source
kind, a pair that already has a human-authored edge of that kind is skipped entirely rather than
upserted — an upsert would silently rewrite a moderator's decision as a machine guess.

Edges are written as `complements` only. Co-occurrence is **not** evidence of fitment: it cannot
support `compatible_with` or `spare_part_of`, and claiming otherwise would turn a correlation into
the safety claim §15.3 reserves for `moderator_curated`.

This job was the raw material for a `trending` rail strategy, and **Phase 13 built it**. The
`trending` and `recommended` strategies now read `commerce_product_ranking_state`.
`trending_placeholder` survives, still returning an empty list, and is deliberately never
removed: while it exists, backing Phase 13 out is a per-rail data edit rather than a deploy.

## 16. Manufacturer directory — the factory browse surface

> **Status: SHIPPED (Phase 17, `0099`–`0101`).** All three surfaces are served. The sections below
> are kept in the present tense because they are the specification the code was built against and
> the argument it has to keep honouring — chiefly §16.1's rule that a factory is a projection, and
> §16.2's third conflict, which was resolved by BUILDING the audit record rather than dropping the
> state. The one addition beyond the frontend's contract is `otherCertifications[]` on the detail
> read; see Phase 17 in §12.

### 16.1 A factory is a projection, not a new entity

The temptation this section exists to defeat is building `commerce_factory_*` to match the
frontend's proposed schema field for field. Do not. **A manufacturer is a `commerce_organization`
that sells physical goods and has declared how it makes them**, and Phase 12 already built most of
what the directory renders. A parallel table set would give one organization two capability lists
that can disagree, and the disagreement is the bug — not the duplication.

The second temptation, already forbidden in `catalog.schemas.ts`, is synthesising the directory by
searching products and grouping by seller. That ranks a manufacturer by whichever of its listings
happened to match a keyword, which is not a claim about the manufacturer at all.

What the frontend renders, and what already answers it:

| Frontend field                               | Already exists                                                                                                                                                      |

`commerce_seller_profile` was built for a storefront page and reads as a factory profile because that
is what a Phase 12 seller is. `visitPolicy`'s own comment in the schema says "whether a buyer may
visit the **factory**". The directory is the browse surface that profile never got.

### 16.2 Three conflicts between the shipped model and the proposed contract

Each of these is a place where building the frontend's contract literally would be wrong, and where
building the backend's model literally would not serve the page.

**1. The capability vocabularies overlap by two values out of six.**

- Shipped `commerce_organization_capability_kind`: `oem`, `odm`, `customization`,
  `in_house_inspection`, `in_house_rnd`, `sample_production`.
- Proposed `FACTORY_CAPABILITY_KINDS`: `odm`, `oem`, `contract_manufacturing`, `private_label`,
  `tooling_and_moulds`, `assembly`.

Resolve by **`ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE`** on the shipped enum — additive, no data migration, no rewrite
of the rows Phase 12 already collected — and widen the frontend tuple to the union. `oem` and `odm`
are already the two the tile advertises and they stay the two that matter: an ODM designs the product
and sells you the design, an OEM builds to a design you already own, and a buyer arriving with
drawings needs a different row from a buyer arriving with an idea.

`customization` and `private_label` are **not merged**, and the distinction is not pedantry:
customization is "we will change this product for you", private label is "we will put your name on
ours". A factory frequently does one and refuses the other.

**2. The certification vocabulary is closed on one side and open on the other.**

The frontend wants a closed 8-value set so the filter chips are buildable and two spellings of one
standard cannot sit side by side. `commerce_organization_certification.standardName` is free text,
deliberately — "the vocabulary is the world's", and a factory holds standards no enum will ever
enumerate.

Both are right. Resolve by adding a **nullable `standardCode`** column over a new seeded enum
(`iso_9001`, `iso_14001`, `bsci`, `sedex_smeta`, `gots`, `fsc`, `ce_marking`, `fda_registered`),
keeping `standardName` as the display string. The filter reads `standardCode`; anything outside the
set carries `standardCode IS NULL` and **still renders on the detail page**. This is exactly the split
the frontend's own header already asks for when it says anything outside the set "rides in
`issuingBody` as free text, where it is read rather than matched".

The read-time expiry rule carries over unchanged and is load-bearing: there is no `expired` state,
because lapsing is `valid_until < current_date` evaluated at read time. A nightly job to flip a state
would be wrong between ticks and would publish a lapsed certificate until the next run.

**3. `verificationState` and `lastAuditedAt` have nothing behind them at all.**

`FACTORY_VERIFICATION_STATES` is `unverified | documents_reviewed | site_audited`, and
`FactoryDetail.lastAuditedAt` is "the ISO date of the most recent site audit". **No site-audit record
exists anywhere in this schema.** `commerce_organization_verification` covers business registration,
tax registration, identity, address and bank account — paperwork, all of it. `site_audited` asserts
that somebody stood in the building.

Two ways forward, and only these two:

- Drop `site_audited` and `lastAuditedAt` from the wire until a record exists. The directory ships
  with two states and is honest.
- Add `commerce_organization_site_audit` — auditor identity, audit date, scope summary, the sites
  covered — and derive the third state from an approved row.

**Never derive `site_audited` from a document review.** That is the precise collapse the frontend's
own rule forbids, and it is the same mistake `FACTORY_VERIFICATION_LABELS` is written to prevent when
it says "documents"/"site" in every string. A verification state is about the **organization**, never
about a capability: `site_audited` does not mean this factory is approved to do injection moulding,
and there is no per-capability approval on the wire at all. Never render a bare tick.

### 16.3 What is genuinely new

Four additions, and they are small because §16.1 did most of the work.

`commerce_organization_production_line`

- `id`, `organizationId`, `name`, `processSummary`, `position`
- `monthlyCapacityUnits` (nullable), `unitLabel` (required beside it), timestamps
- unique `(organizationId, position)`

Today `commerce_seller_profile.productionLineCount` is a bare integer. **The unit is required beside
the capacity** for the same reason the MOQ pair is both-or-neither: a capacity with no unit cannot be
compared against an order.

`commerce_organization_site`

- `id`, `organizationId`, `label`, `countryCode`, `locality` (nullable)
- `floorAreaSquareMetres` (nullable), `productionStaffCount` (nullable), timestamps

Distinct from `commerce_organization_site_access`, which carries only transport modes
(`road | sea | air | rail`) and is about reaching a site rather than describing one. State the
relationship to the org-wide `commerce_seller_profile.factoryAreaSquareMetres` explicitly in the
projection: the org-wide figure is seller-declared and the per-site figures are seller-declared, and
if they disagree **the read publishes both rather than summing or reconciling them**. A platform that
silently prefers one is asserting something neither party said.

Org-level sample policy and order bounds, as columns on `commerce_seller_profile`:

- `offersSamples`, `sampleLeadTimeDays`, `sampleFeeInCents`, `currency`
- `minimumOrderQuantity`, `minimumOrderQuantityUnitLabel`
- `minimumLeadTimeDays`, `maximumLeadTimeDays`

**`sampleFeeInCents = null` means unstated and `0` means free.** Two different facts, and the one
thing this surface must not do is render an unstated fee as free — a buyer who orders a sample on that
basis finds out at invoice time. The MOQ pair is both-or-neither: a bare `500` is unreadable, because
500 pieces and 500 cartons are different businesses.

`exportMarkets[]` — **and this one needs a decision before a column.** "ISO country codes this factory
has actually shipped to" is a _derived_ claim, computable from settled order delivery addresses. If it
is instead seller-declared it must be labelled declared, per A13's rule that a derived stat and a
declared stat are visibly different on the wire — which is why the storefront carries `declaredProfile`
and `measuredMetrics` and nothing else. Pick one and put it in the matching member. An empty array is
a fact, not a gap.

### 16.4 Public API

| Method | Route                           | Purpose                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/store/factories`              | Filterable manufacturer directory                               |
| GET    | `/store/factories/:factorySlug` | One factory: lines, certifications, sites, sample policy, audit |

Query keys, camelCase over a `.strict()` schema: `capabilityKind`, `countryCode`, `certification`,
`maxMinimumOrderQuantity`, `limit`, `cursor`. `maxMinimumOrderQuantity` is an upper bound on the
factory's own MOQ — "show me factories that will take an order this small" — and admits NULL, because
"no MOQ declared" satisfies it, which is the A25 rule about NULL facets applied here.

**Every key above ships with the endpoint or comes out of the frontend first.** A `.strict()` query
schema answers **422** for an unrecognized key rather than ignoring it, and `providers.schemas.ts`
documents at length what that costs: seven filters were specified there and one was built, and the
directory row still cannot say what the provider does. Repeating that in a contract written from
scratch would be choosing it — which is why `capabilityKinds[]` is projected on the **card**, not only
the detail.

`certifications[]` on the card carries names only; validity windows live on the detail read, because a
card that shows a certification cannot tell you whether it has lapsed and must not imply that it
has not.

### 16.5 The inquiry, and the one decision it still needs

`CreateFactoryInquiryInput` — `capabilityKind`, `productDescription`, `estimatedAnnualQuantity`,
`unitLabel`, `targetUnitPriceInCents`, `currency`, `requiredCertifications[]`,
`desiredFirstDeliveryAt`, `notes` — is **field for field a single-recipient RFQ**.

`commerce_product_inquiry` cannot carry it. That table requires a `productId` and is uniquely indexed
on `(productId, buyerOrganizationId)`; a manufacturing inquiry has no product, which is the whole
point of sending it. Two options:

- **Reuse `commerce_rfq`** with `visibility = 'invited_only'` and exactly one
  `commerce_rfq_invitation`. Free: the quote revision flow, the thread, trade attachments, expiry and
  the whole state machine. Costs: a manufacturing shape on a table built for service sourcing, and an
  RFQ list that now contains rows a buyer did not think of as RFQs.
- **A thin `commerce_manufacturing_inquiry`** with its own `draft | sent | answered | closed`, a
  human-quotable `reference`, and a `convertedToRfqId` the way `commerce_product_inquiry` already has
  one.

The second is recommended, for the reason A14 gives for keeping a pre-sales inquiry out of the RFQ
thread: an RFQ thread has every invited provider in it, so folding a one-to-one conversation into that
shape exposes one seller's chat to its competitors. A manufacturing inquiry is one-to-one by
definition.

Whichever ships, three rules hold:

- **`POST` answers `draft`, always.** Creating a draft notifies nobody, exactly as an RFQ does, so no
  success copy may say "sent". The response is the table's own columns, not a projection — the success
  screen has no factory object to read and must not pretend otherwise.
- **A `sent` transition route and a `/commerce/factories/inquiries/mine` read are both required**, and
  neither is specified today. `src/hooks/store/factories.ts` records the missing `/mine` as the reason
  its mutation invalidates nothing. A create with no transition and no list is a write into a hole.
- **`capabilityKind` is required**, because it is the one field that decides whether the inquiry is
  answerable at all. A buyer who needs tooling and writes to an assembly-only shop should find that out
  from the form, not from silence three weeks later.

`Idempotency-Key` is required on the create. A retry without one is a second inquiry in the factory's
queue.

## 17. Business forum — the public text surface

> **Status: SHIPPED (Phase 18, `0102`–`0103`).** Two public reads on `/store` and twelve writes at
> `/community`, including every one §17.3 says the frontend renders and cannot produce. The sections
> below are the specification the code was built against; §17.1's reasoning in particular is the
> thing to read before anybody "fixes" `pending_review` into an immediate publish.

### 17.1 Why a new thread is `pending_review` and not `open`

A10 closed public product comments, and the reasoning was never about listings. It was that a comment
would be **"the only public text surface with no purchase proof and no standing requirement behind
it"**. Reviews require a completed order, Q&A requires a seller relationship or a verified purchase,
private inquiries require an authenticated buyer organization. A free-floating text box requires
nothing.

A standalone forum is a different surface from a listing comment, and it inherits that problem
exactly: public text, written by anyone, attached to a commerce platform's domain.

**Moderation is what lets the forum exist without reopening A10.** It is the same shape the platform
already runs for research papers and for service offerings — `draft` → `pending_review` → a
moderator decides. So `POST` answers `pending_review`, the public reads filter that state out the way
the provider directory never returns a `draft` offering, and the composer says "queued for review" and
means it.

**Do not "fix" this into an immediate publish** because a forum usually publishes immediately. This
one has a documented reason not to, and the reason is the decision A10 already made.

### 17.2 Tables

Model these on `research_program_post` and its reaction/report/moderation siblings — the closest
already-built precedent in this codebase, a threaded board with a moderation queue in front of it.
Copying a shipped shape is worth more here than a clean-sheet design.

`community_forum_thread`

- `id`, immutable `slug`, `board`, `title`, `body`
- `authorUserId`, `authorOrganizationId` (nullable)
- `state`: `pending_review | open | answered | locked`
- `acceptedReplyId` (nullable), `replyCount`, `lastActivityAt`, timestamps
- `board`: `sourcing | logistics_and_customs | compliance_and_certification |
payments_and_trade_finance | manufacturing | selling_on_qatoto`
- queue index `(state, createdAt, id)`; browse index `(board, state, lastActivityAt, id)`

**Six boards, matching the work rather than the org chart**, each mapping to a thing a business gets
stuck on and to a surface this platform already has — sourcing to the catalogue, logistics and customs
to `/store/providers`, compliance to factory certifications, payments to quotes and orders. **A
"General" board is deliberately absent**: it is where every thread ends up when nobody can decide, and
a board nobody can characterise is a board nobody subscribes to.

`community_forum_reply`

- `id`, `threadId`, `authorUserId`, `authorOrganizationId` (nullable), `body`
- `helpfulCount`, visibility state, timestamps

`community_forum_reply_vote`

- `replyId`, `userId`, `createdAt`; primary key `(replyId, userId)`

Four rules the projection must hold:

- **`authorOrganizationName` is nullable and that is a real distinction, not a missing join.** Somebody
  posting as an individual has no organization behind them, and a reader weighing an answer about
  customs clearance wants to know whether it came from a broker or from a stranger. Rendering a
  placeholder organization erases exactly the signal the field exists to carry.
- **`answered` is derived from `acceptedReplyId`** and carried separately so a list row does not have
  to fetch replies to know. `acceptedReplyId = null` is **not** "nobody helped" — plenty of useful
  threads never get an accepted answer. It means only that nobody pressed the button.
- **`helpfulCount` is a count, not a score.** There is no downvote on the wire and there must never be
  one: a negative signal against a named organization on a commerce platform is a reputational act,
  and this surface has no appeal process to put behind it.
- **`excerpt` is server-truncated.** The card carries first lines; only the detail read carries the
  whole opening post.

The vote shape copies `commerce_product_answer_vote` exactly, **including that `PUT` and `DELETE` of a
boolean take no `Idempotency-Key`** — they are idempotent by verb (A24). Per-viewer vote state is
projected as a `viewer` member that is `null` for an anonymous reader and never a defaulted `false`,
which is the A11/A24 rule.

### 17.3 The writes the frontend renders and cannot produce

**This is the most important subsection here.** `ForumThreadDetail` renders a cursor page of replies,
a `helpfulCount` on each and an `acceptedReplyId` on the thread. There is **no endpoint for any of
them** — the frontend contract has exactly one write, thread creation. A forum that ships with only
thread-create is a wall of unanswerable questions.

Public reads (added to §5):

| Method | Route                              | Purpose                                                    |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/store/forum/threads`             | Board-filtered thread list; never returns `pending_review` |
| GET    | `/store/forum/threads/:threadSlug` | One thread, its body, and a cursor page of replies         |

Authenticated writes, mounted at `/community` (§1.1):

| Method | Route                                               | Result                                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/community/forum/threads`                          | Create; answers `pending_review`. Idempotency-Key   |
| POST   | `/community/forum/threads/:threadId/replies`        | Append a reply. Idempotency-Key                     |
| POST   | `/community/forum/threads/:threadId/accepted-reply` | The thread author marks the answer                  |
| DELETE | `/community/forum/threads/:threadId/accepted-reply` | Unmark it                                           |
| PUT    | `/community/forum/replies/:replyId/helpful`         | Endorse                                             |
| DELETE | `/community/forum/replies/:replyId/helpful`         | Withdraw the endorsement                            |
| GET    | `/community/forum/threads/mine`                     | The author's own threads, `pending_review` included |
| GET    | `/community/admin/forum/threads`                    | Moderation queue                                    |
| POST   | `/community/admin/forum/threads/:threadId/moderate` | Publish, reject, or lock                            |

`/mine` is not optional. Without it, an author who posts a thread has no way to learn what happened to
it — the create response is the last thing they ever see, and `pending_review` appears in no public
read by design.

Replies require a thread in `open` or `answered`; a `locked` thread refuses with a tagged error rather
than a silent no-op. Only the thread author may accept an answer, and accepting one on a `locked`
thread is allowed — locking stops new text, not bookkeeping.

### 17.4 Reporting and moderation

Use a new `community_content_report` rather than adding `forum_thread` and `forum_reply` members to
`commerce_content_target_kind`. The precedent is Phase 10, which built `commerce_content_report`
instead of generalizing the R&D `content_review_action` table, because the two queues are gated by
different capabilities and merging them creates **"the coupling capabilities exist to prevent"**. The
same call applies: a commerce moderator working a counterfeit-listing queue and a community moderator
working an off-topic-thread queue are not the same shift.

Gate on the existing `moderate_content` platform capability rather than minting a new one. There is no
community equivalent of an organization role here — a forum has no members, only authors.

## 18. Cofounder matching — the people directory

> **Status: SHIPPED (Phase 19, `0104`–`0105`) WITHOUT THE CAPITAL FIGURES.** §14's decision is still
> open, so the build respects it literally rather than waiting on it: the directory, the detail read
> and the full lifecycle are live, and `community_cofounder_profile` has no capital or equity column
> at all. Both wire fields serve `null` and the create schema answers 422 for either. §18.2's table
> listing is therefore aspirational in exactly one respect — the capital triple and
> `equityExpectationBasisPoints` are specified there and deliberately unbuilt. Everything else in
> §18 is code.

### 18.1 Four rules the backend enforces, because the client is untrusted

The frontend wrote three of these into its own schema file. **A rule that lives only on the frontend
is not a rule** — it is a comment on code an attacker can edit. Each one below is a sentence the
response body must be unable to support.

1. **A stated capital range is self-reported and unverified.** Nobody checked. No field, label,
   derived value or aggregate may imply "committed", "funded", "raised", "escrowed" or "available",
   and the projection labels the figure as declared _in the row_, not in a tooltip a renderer can drop.
   A number that looks audited is worse than no number.
2. **A profile is not an offer and Qatoto is not a broker.** Listing yourself is not soliciting
   investment; reading a profile is not receiving advice. There is no "invest" affordance, no "matched"
   language, and **no ranking that could read as a recommendation** — which is why the directory read
   takes no `sort` parameter at all. Ordering is deterministic and boring on purpose.
3. **This is not equity.** Nothing on this surface mints, holds, transfers or records a stake.
   `equityExpectationBasisPoints` is an **ask** — the number someone hopes to negotiate towards — and
   is projected as an expectation, never as an allocation or a holding. Basis points, not a float
   percentage, for the same reason money is integer cents: `0.075` and `7.5` are one careless division
   apart, and an equity figure wrong by two orders of magnitude is the worst thing this surface could
   render.
4. **`identity_verified` means only that this person is who they say they are.** It says nothing about
   their capital, their track record or their reach, none of which anybody checked. This is why the
   state tuple is two values and not a ladder — a third rung would be read as verifying the claims.

### 18.2 Tables

`community_cofounder_profile`

- `id`, immutable `slug`, `userId` (unique — one profile per person)
- `displayName`, `headline`, `bio`, `lookingFor`, `countryCode`, `avatarUrl` (nullable)
- `commitmentLevel`: `full_time | part_time | advisory`
- `engagementState`: `open_to_intros | in_conversation | not_looking`
- `identityState`: `unverified | identity_verified`
- `state`: `draft | pending_review | published | withdrawn`
- `capitalRangeMinInCents`, `capitalRangeMaxInCents`, `currency` — all three nullable together
- `equityExpectationBasisPoints` (nullable), `publishedAt` (nullable), timestamps
- `contributionKinds` and `sectors` as link tables, in `talent_profile_skill`'s shape
- `CHECK` that the capital triple is all-null or all-set

`community_cofounder_prior_venture`

- `id`, `profileId`, `name`, `roleLabel`, `yearsActiveLabel`, `outcomeSummary` (nullable), `position`

**The near-miss, and why it stays a near-miss.** `talent_profile` is already user-scoped with
availability, visibility, skills and a compensation ask, and it is genuinely close. **Do not extend
it.** The R&D talent directory reads that table, and a cofounder row landing in "people open to work
on your project" is a different claim about a different person's intent. Reuse its _shape_ — and
`talent_profile_skill`'s tag-table pattern for `sectors` — not its rows.

Three projection rules:

- **`capitalRange` is both-or-neither, and the whole object is nullable rather than its fields.** Half
  a range is not "a floor with no ceiling", it is an unanswerable question. `null` means they did not
  say; it is not zero, and a renderer must show an absence. A blank field is _omitted_ from the create
  body, never sent as `0` — `0` for a capital minimum publishes an offer of nothing, and `0` basis
  points publishes an expectation of no stake, which nobody means.
- **`not_looking` stays visible in the directory** rather than being filtered out. A profile is also a
  record, and hiding it makes a person who is mid-conversation look as though they had left. The row
  says so and offers no contact affordance. This is why the list filter accepts no `state` key.
- **`contributionKinds` are four and are not interchangeable**: `capital` is money, `expertise` is a
  domain somebody has already done, `influence` is reach, `operations` is the person who runs the
  thing day to day. Claiming all four is itself a signal, and the projection must not collapse them.

### 18.3 The lifecycle the contract is missing

As specified today, `POST` answers `draft`, public reads return only `published`, and **there is no
publish route, no `/mine` read and no withdraw**. A user creates a profile that nobody can ever see,
including themselves.

Public reads (added to §5):

| Method | Route                                    | Purpose                                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/store/cofounder-profiles`              | The directory; `published` only               |
| GET    | `/store/cofounder-profiles/:profileSlug` | One profile with prior ventures and languages |

Filter keys: `contributionKind`, `commitmentLevel`, `countryCode`, `limit`, `cursor`. No `sort`, and
no `state` — see rule 2 and the `not_looking` rule above.

Authenticated writes, mounted at `/community` (§1.1):

| Method | Route                                                     | Result                                            |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/community/cofounder-profiles`                           | Create your own; answers `draft`. Idempotency-Key |
| GET    | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine`                      | The viewer's own profile in any state             |
| PATCH  | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine`                      | Edit while `draft` or `withdrawn`                 |
| POST   | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine/submit`               | `draft` → `pending_review`                        |
| POST   | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine/withdraw`             | Out of the directory, reversibly                  |
| PATCH  | `/community/cofounder-profiles/mine/engagement-state`     | Move between the three engagement states          |
| GET    | `/community/admin/cofounder-profiles`                     | Moderation queue                                  |
| POST   | `/community/admin/cofounder-profiles/:profileId/moderate` | Publish or reject                                 |

**The viewer posts about themselves, never about somebody else**, and there is deliberately no route
by which one person lists another: a directory of people who did not consent to being in it is a
different product with a different legal shape. `userId` is unique for the same reason.

`engagement-state` is its own route rather than a field on the `PATCH` because it is the one edit a
**published** profile may make without re-entering moderation. Everything else — headline, bio,
capital range — is content a moderator approved, and changing it after approval must go back through
`submit`.

### 18.4 Identity, and what not to invent

`identity_verified` needs a source, and there are already two candidates in the codebase. Pick one and
record which:

- `requireIdentifiedUser` is **user-scoped** and already runs in front of the category-request write
  (§6.5). It exists because `src/lib/auth.ts` registers the `anonymous()` plugin, so a session proves
  nothing about identity on its own.
- `commerce_verification_kind = 'identity'` is **organization-scoped** and is the wrong tool — a
  cofounder is a person, and requiring an organization to list yourself contradicts §18.2.

The first is the fit. **Do not add a third identity notion for this surface.** If the standard
`requireIdentifiedUser` enforces is not strong enough to carry the badge, raise that standard where it
lives rather than building a parallel one here — two definitions of "identified" is how one of them
silently becomes the weaker.

## 19. Lane rate cards and the arrival window — the delivery surface

**SHIPPED (Phase 20, `0106`–`0109`).** This section was written as a specification, and it is now a
record. The tables exist, the admin writes fill them, the rating read prices a lane, and an order
projects an arrival window. **Migrations applied 2026-08-10**; `db:verify-store-phase-20-constraints`
passes 17/17 against the live database, so every CHECK in §19.2–§19.4 is confirmed to actually
refuse rather than merely to have been written.

**They ship EMPTY, and that is the remaining gap.** No forwarder lane list has been bought and no
broker dwell figure recorded, so every lane is uncovered until somebody loads real data through
§19.5's admin routes. There is deliberately no seed: a made-up rate is a claim the platform would
then own, which is §19.4's own argument applied to its own migration. `sheets/delivery-sheet.tsx`
can now wire against real contracts; what it renders stays honest-and-empty until the rows arrive.

**Where §19 was silent, §19.8 records what was chosen. Where this backend deliberately behaves
differently from Alibaba — and where it currently behaves worse — §19.9 says so.**

### 19.1 What A16 decided, and what it left out

A16 chose a **coverage-derived estimate**: `GET /store/products/:productSlug/delivery-estimate`
walks the provider offerings whose declared coverage matches the seller's shipping origin and the
buyer's destination, and returns one `DeliveryEstimateProjection` per currency — an integer-cent
range, a lead-time day range, the basis it was computed from, and the offerings it was derived
from. That shipped, and it stands.

What it cannot express is a **choice**. The mock sheet decomposes the journey into an
international leg and an inland leg and lets the buyer pick a mode per leg, with a price and a
duration behind each option. Coverage does not carry either number per mode — it says a provider
_serves_ this lane, not what it _charges_ or how long it _takes_ by sea versus by air. So the
sheet sums local floats today, which is the client establishing a price, which §0 forbids.

The missing input is not an endpoint. It is **data nobody has bought**: forwarders sell lane
price lists, and Qatoto stores none.

### 19.2 Rate cards

```text
commerce_freight_rate_card
  id, providerOrganizationId → commerce_organization
  originCountryCode, destinationCountryCode
  mode                       -- REUSE commerce_shipment_leg_mode: air | sea | land | rail
  currency
  validFrom, validUntil
  sourceForwarderName        -- who sold us this list; provenance rides with the number
  volumetricDivisorCm3PerKg  -- §19.9. REQUIRED. cm³/kg; ocean W/M 1000, road ~3000, air 5000-6000
  state                      -- active | superseded | withdrawn
  createdAt, updatedAt
```

```text
commerce_freight_rate_break
  id, rateCardId → commerce_freight_rate_card (on delete cascade)
  minBillableWeightGrams, minVolumeCubicCm
  unitPriceInCents, minimumChargeInCents
  transitDaysMin, transitDaysMax
  position
  UNIQUE (rateCardId, position)
```

**Do not mint a second mode enum.** `commerce_shipment_leg_mode` already has these four members
and a leg already records one; a parallel enum is how a card becomes unmatchable to the shipment
it priced.

**Transit days live on the BREAK, not the card.** An air break and a sea break on the same lane
have different durations by definition, and a heavier break can route differently — a 40 kg
consignment and a 4 t consignment on one lane are not the same journey. Putting the duration on
the card forces one number across every weight band, which is the same flattening A13 rejected.

### 19.3 Customs dwell

```text
commerce_customs_dwell_estimate
  id
  destinationCountryCode
  originCountryCode          -- NULLABLE: null means "any origin"
  commodityScope             -- NULLABLE: null means "any commodity"
  clearanceDaysMin, clearanceDaysMax
  source                     -- the broker or published figure this came from
  validFrom, validUntil
```

Nothing models this today. `customs_broker` exists as a `commerce_provider_kind` and its
offerings carry lead times, but "clearance on this lane for this commodity takes 3–10 days" is
stored nowhere, and an offering's lead time is the broker's own turnaround, not the port's.

**A domestic lane has no customs leg at all.** That is an _absent_ component, not a zero-day one,
and §19.4's projection must be able to say which — see the two-facts rule below.

### 19.4 The arrival window

A new projection on the order, and on `checkout/prepare` once the cart has a delivery address:

```text
{
  clockStartAt,
  components: {
    manufacturing: { daysMin, daysMax },
    freight:       { daysMin, daysMax, rateCardId, mode } | null,
    customs:       { daysMin, daysMax, source } | null,
  },
  arrivalWindow:     { fromDate, toDate } | null,
  missingComponents: ("freight" | "customs")[],
}
```

**`clockStartAt` is `order.confirmedAt`.** State it on the wire rather than leaving the client to
assume, because "confirmed", "payment settled" and "first shipment event" give three different
answers and the buyer is entitled to know which promise they were given.

**`arrivalWindow` is emitted only when every applicable component resolves.** No rate card for
the lane, no mode selected yet, or no dwell estimate → the window is **`null`** and
`missingComponents` names what is missing. **A missing component is never defaulted, averaged or
extrapolated.** It is reported.

**`customs: null` carries two different facts and they must be distinguishable.** On a domestic
lane there is no customs leg — the component is absent, the window still closes, and
`missingComponents` stays empty. On a cross-border lane with no dwell estimate the component is
unknown, and the window cannot close. Modelling both as a bare `null` collapses "not applicable"
into "not known", which is the A11 mistake in a new place.

**This is Alibaba's degradation, chosen deliberately.** When a buyer does not book freight
through Alibaba, the listing keeps showing the seller-declared manufacturing lead time and marks
shipping as to-be-arranged; **no delivery date appears at all.** The estimated-delivery date
surfaces only once a logistics option with real rates behind it is selected. The alternative —
approximating the freight and customs legs from a regional average — was **not chosen**: B2B
freight variance is large enough that an average is wrong more often than right (a container
sitting at port for three weeks is ordinary, not an outlier), and a printed number is a claim the
platform then owns. Amazon prints a single date because it owns the network and absorbs the risk;
Qatoto owns neither.

**The components ship alongside the window, never collapsed into it.** 15–25 manufacturing +
3–10 customs + 18–30 sea is a **29-day spread**; presenting that as one date is false precision,
and presenting it as three visible parts is an estimate a buyer can reason about. It also means
the client always has something honest to render when `arrivalWindow` is `null` — "ships in
15–25 days after order · shipping and clearance not yet estimated" — rather than an empty state.

**No arrival window before an order exists.** With no clock start there is no calendar, so a
product page shows _durations_ only. This is why the PDP and the order page differ, and it is not
an inconsistency.

`checkout/prepare` gains the §19.4 projection alongside its existing `deliveryEstimates`.

### 19.6 Rules

- **A rate card produces a range with its provenance, never a single day.** `sourceForwarderName`
  and `validUntil` travel with every option; an expired card is not a price.
- **An uncovered lane returns an empty `options[]`, never a zero**, and an uncovered _leg_ makes
  the whole journey unpriceable rather than cheaper. A15's and A16's rule, unchanged.
- **Partial data yields a partial answer, never an extrapolated whole one.** §19.2, §19.3 and
  §19.4 are three expressions of this one rule: report the components you have, name the ones you
  do not. It is the call A16 made for money, applied to time.
- **Rating from a card never writes `shippingInCents`.** Nothing is charged for freight until
  something is booked; `shippingInCents` stays literal `0` at checkout. That is A16's decision,
  not a gap this section closes.
- **The client never sums legs or components.** The server returns the journey total and the
  arrival window already computed — integer cents, whole days, per currency, never converting
  between currencies without an FX quote (§15.4's rule).
- **A rate card is not a booking and confers no capacity.** Pricing from a card does not reserve
  space, and no copy may imply it does.
- **Every price is a named provider's, structurally.** The money lives inside `providerQuote`
  alongside the forwarder's identity and `subjectToRemeasurement`, so no client can render a rate
  without rendering whose rate it is. Qatoto sells no freight (§0).
- **An unrateable lane still names who could quote it.** `quotableProviders` carries the forwarders
  selling that lane so the buyer can open an RFQ. A refusal that offers no way forward is a dead
  end, not honesty.

### 19.7 Frontend status

`src/components/home/store/sheets/delivery-sheet.tsx` was **held at `TRANSPORT: mock` against this
section** — the one store sheet deliberately left unwired. §19.2–§19.4 are now built, so it can be
wired; with no rate cards loaded it must render the named absences (`unavailableReasons`,
`unpriceableReasons`, `missingComponents`) rather than a zero or a date. `sections/delivery-cost.tsx` wires against the _existing_ A16 estimate and
degrades to the manufacturing lead time plus "shipping to be arranged" when the estimate array is
empty; it must not render a date or a zero.

### 19.8 Where §19 was silent, and what was chosen

§19 was written before the code and left real questions open. Each was decided during Phase 20;
each is recorded here rather than only in a comment, because the next reader of this document is
usually the person deciding whether to change one.

#### Pricing and band selection

- **Freight bills on chargeable weight, `max(actual, volumetric)`** (`0109`, §19.9). The divisor is
  a **required per-card column** — never a platform constant, because it varies by forwarder as well
  as by mode. Volumetric weight rounds **up**, ties resolve to the `actual` basis, and the band
  ladder selects on the chargeable figure because that is what a tariff's "45 kg+" band means.
- **An undeclared volume refuses to rate** (`volume_not_declared`) rather than falling back to gross
  weight, which would reintroduce underpricing on the bulkiest consignments.

- **`unitPriceInCents` is CENTS PER KILOGRAM of chargeable weight.** §19.2 lists a unit price beside
  two `min*` floors and never says which the price is per. This is the one assumption that, if a
  future writer disagreed, would make a published number **wrong** rather than absent — so it is
  named in three places: the column comment, the migration banner, and
  `BILLABLE_WEIGHT_UNIT_GRAMS` in the rating service. The two `min*` columns are the band's
  **entry condition**, not its denominator.
- **A band's two floors are conjunctive (AND).** A weight-only band is authored with
  `minVolumeCubicCm: 0`. AND is monotone, which is what makes "the highest qualifying band" well
  defined; OR would let a bulky-but-light consignment fall into a heavy band's cheap per-kg rate.
- **Bands are ordered by their FLOORS, not by `position`.** `position` is authoring order and its
  unique index does not make it monotone in weight; it survives only as the final tie-break.
- **Below the smallest band yields NO option, not the minimum charge.** A card whose smallest band
  starts at 45 kg is a tariff that says so; charging a 5 kg parcel from it extrapolates out of a
  band the forwarder excluded. Floor coverage is one reviewable row (`minBillableWeightGrams: 0`).
- **There is no "above the largest band".** Bands carry floors and no ceilings, so the top band is
  open-ended by construction. Capping a forwarder's tariff would be the platform authoring a price.
- **An unknown weight never rates**, and an unknown volume cannot clear a positive volume floor.
- **Prices round UP.** Rounding a freight charge down publishes a number the forwarder will not
  honour, and the platform would own the difference.

#### Cards and the read predicate

- **`currency` was added to §19.5's option shape.** A `priceInCents` with no currency is
  unrenderable, and a list mixing USD and EUR is the collapse A16 refused.
- **The rating read selects on the WINDOW plus `state <> 'withdrawn'`, never on `state = 'active'`.**
  A future-dated successor supersedes its incumbent the moment it is written, while the incumbent's
  window is still open — reading on the state would black out a lane from the instant an admin
  scheduled next month's tariff. The partial unique index is a **write** invariant only.
- **A card is append-only in its commercial content.** POST supersedes and mints; PATCH may only
  shorten a window or withdraw. Lane, mode, currency, `validFrom` and `sourceForwarderName` are
  absent from every PATCH schema, so `.strict()` refuses them loudly. Rewriting a number under an
  unchanged provenance string is a claim that forwarder never made.
- **`breaks` is required on create**, 1..20, written in the same transaction. A two-call create
  would leave the lane priced by nothing between the two requests, because the create supersedes.
- **A live card's bands are frozen** (`409 …_IN_FORCE`); only a card staged for the future can be
  corrected. A ladder has no monotone insertion.
- **The uniqueness key is (provider, lane, mode, currency)**, not the bare lane: §19.5's `options[]`
  is plural and §19.1's estimate is per-currency, so a bare-lane key would make a second
  forwarder's card unstorable.

#### Legs and journeys

- **`journeys[]` was added beyond §19.5's `legs[]`.** §19.6 forbids the client summing legs, which
  `legs[]` alone cannot satisfy.
- **The inland leg is on the DESTINATION side, and there are at most two legs.** Nothing in the
  schema says where an inland leg starts — cards are keyed by country pair and no rate table is
  keyed by a locality — so an origin-side leg would be unpriceable by construction and would poison
  every journey under the uncovered-leg rule.
- **Localities are labels.** They render; they never select a card.
- **A journey is never summed across currencies**, and an uncovered leg empties `journeys[]`
  entirely rather than pricing the international leg alone.

#### Customs dwell

- **Precedence is origin-scoped > commodity-scoped > any**, ties broken by latest `validFrom` then
  `id` so two admins cannot make the endpoint flap.
- **Commodity matching is exact-or-null; category ancestors are deliberately NOT walked.** Walking
  them would apply a broad figure to a narrow commodity, the same flattening §19.2 rejected for
  transit days. A mixed-category order falls back to the any-commodity row.
- **Overlap between two CLOSED windows is a service-level 409**, not a constraint: `now()` is not
  IMMUTABLE, and a real exclusion would need `btree_gist` for one table.

#### The arrival window

- **Every component is a discriminated union**, not a nullable object. §19.4 demands the
  distinction for customs; it is applied uniformly so the emission rule reads once.
- **`missingComponents` was widened to include `"manufacturing"`.** §19.4 lists only freight and
  customs, but the lead-time snapshot is nullable, so an order whose seller declared no lead time
  would otherwise return a null window with an **empty** `missingComponents` — an unnamed absence,
  which is what §19.6 forbids.
- **The window anchors on the stored `promisedDeliveryAt`, not on `clockStartAt` plus a duration.**
  §19.4 assumes the two clocks share a start; **they do not**. `promisedDeliveryAt` is derived at
  order CREATION while `confirmedAt` is stamped later by settlement, so anchoring on the clock start
  would let payment latency silently shorten the manufacturing leg. `clockStartAt` is still reported
  exactly as §19.4 mandates, with `orderPlacedAt` beside it so the gap is legible rather than hidden.
- **Manufacturing `daysMax` is reconstructed from `promisedDeliveryAt − createdAt`**, losslessly,
  and works on every order ever placed. `daysMin` comes from the `0108` snapshot and is the MAXIMUM
  of the line minimums — an order waits on its slowest line — and is `null` unless **every** line
  declared one.
- **No mode is ever auto-selected.** `?mode=` is optional; omitting it reports
  `freight: unknown / mode_not_selected` with the covered modes listed. Cheapest-wins would publish
  the slowest window as though the buyer had chosen it, and would erase the "no mode selected yet"
  state §19.4 explicitly lists.
- **`checkout/prepare` emits components with `arrivalWindow: null` always.** This resolves §19.5's
  "gains the §19.4 projection" against §19.4's "no arrival window before an order exists".
- **A quote-originated order's destination comes from `commerce_rfq.destinationCountryCode`.**
  `buyerAddressSnapshot` is never parsed — reading geography back out of formatted prose is how a
  comma inside a locality becomes a wrong country.

### 19.9 Measured against Alibaba — what matches, what is stricter, and what is missing

§19.4 justifies the null window by citing Alibaba's degradation. That citation is accurate for the
**window**, and it was worth checking whether it holds for the rest of the phase. It does not hold
uniformly, and the differences are recorded here so nobody re-derives them from an argument that was
only ever made about one decision.

#### Behaves as Alibaba does

| This backend                                                                                           | Alibaba                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| No delivery date until a rated option is selected; lead time plus "shipping to be arranged" until then | Same                                       |
| Per-mode options carrying a price **and** a transit range                                              | Same — sea, air and express side by side   |
| The buyer selects the mode; the server never picks one                                                 | Same                                       |
| Manufacturing lead time as a range, tied to the quantity band                                          | Same — tiered lead times on the listing    |
| A weight-band ladder with a per-unit rate and a minimum charge                                         | Same — the standard forwarder tariff shape |
| Provenance and an expiry on every quoted number                                                        | Same — Alibaba's quotes carry a validity   |

#### Deliberately stricter than Alibaba

Each is defensible, and each has a visible cost. None is a bug; all four are open to being revisited
as product decisions.

- **Below the smallest band yields no option at all.** Alibaba, and every real forwarder, applies the
  band's **minimum charge** to an undersized shipment — that is what a minimum charge is for. §19.6's
  "never a zero" was read here as "never a price outside a published band", which is the stricter
  reading. **Cost:** a 5 kg parcel against a card whose smallest band starts at 45 kg reports an
  uncovered lane where Alibaba reports a price.
- **Currencies are never converted, so a journey whose legs quote in different currencies emits
  nothing.** Alibaba converts and shows the rate. This follows A16 and §15.4 rather than Alibaba.
  **Cost:** a USD ocean card plus a EUR inland card is unpriceable, though both are real prices.
- **An uncovered inland leg makes the whole journey unpriceable.** Alibaba would still sell the
  international leg **port-to-port** and let the buyer arrange the rest — because Alibaba models
  Incoterms and this backend does not. **Cost:** on most lanes, where no forwarder sells a domestic
  card in the destination country, a perfectly good ocean rate goes unshown. **This is the largest
  practical divergence in the phase**, and the fix is an Incoterm concept, not a rate table.
  **Phase 23 shipped the VOCABULARY ONLY** (`commerce_incoterm`, A40): a quote revision can now
  only state a term the ICC publishes. Nothing branches on the value and no leg is modelled from
  it, so this divergence stays open — a delivery term is now spelled correctly, and still means
  nothing to the rating.
- **Customs dwell is exposed as its own component.** Alibaba does not surface it; it bundles
  clearance into the estimate or sells DDP. Here the backend is **more** transparent than Alibaba,
  not less, which is the intended direction.

#### The one genuine gap — `chargeable weight` — is now CLOSED (`0109`)

Air and ocean freight bill on **`max(actual gross weight, volumetric weight)`**, and every forwarder
— Alibaba's included — quotes that way. Phase 20 shipped rating on actual gross weight alone, using
volume only as a band **floor**, so a light bulky consignment was **underpriced**. That was the one
failure mode §19.6 does not cover: not a missing number, a **wrong** one. A container of cushions
weighs nothing and costs a forwarder the same as a container of bolts.

**What the fix is.** `commerce_freight_rate_card.volumetric_divisor_cm3_per_kg` — `NOT NULL`, no
default, `BETWEEN 100 AND 20000`. `computeChargeableWeight(card, consignment)` returns
`max(actual, ceil(volume × 1000 ÷ divisor))` with the winning `basis` named, the band ladder selects
on the result, and the price is computed from it. Every option carries `chargeableWeightGrams` and
`chargeableWeightBasis`, because §19.6 makes the basis of a number travel with the number — without
it a buyer whose 20 kg billed as 3,000 kg reads a correct volumetric charge as an error.

**Why a column rather than a constant.** The divisor is a tariff convention that varies by
**forwarder** as well as by mode: air is 5000 or 6000 depending on who is quoting, ocean LCL is 1000
(the W/M "revenue ton" — one cubic metre billed as 1000 kg), road is around 3000. One constant per
mode would price a 5000-divisor air tariff wrong, and would be the platform choosing a convention on
a forwarder's behalf — the error §19.4 refuses everywhere else. The single formula covers all four
modes, so no per-mode branching exists anywhere in the rating path.

**`NOT NULL` was affordable only because the table was still empty.** Nothing to backfill, no default
to invent. That will not be true for the next person: once cards exist, this column pattern needs a
real per-card figure per row, and a blanket default would silently reprice every lane.

**Chargeable weight is PER CARD, never per consignment.** The divisor belongs to the forwarder, so
one consignment legitimately bills as two different weights across a two-leg journey — 1 m³ is
1000 kg to the ocean carrier and ~333 kg to the road carrier. It therefore rides
`FreightJourneyLegSelection`, not `ConsignmentMeasurement`; a single journey-level weight would make
one of the two leg prices read as an arithmetic error.

**An undeclared volume refuses**, with a named `volume_not_declared`, rather than falling back to
gross weight. The fallback would silently reintroduce the underpricing on exactly the consignments
most likely to be bulky — the ones whose seller never measured a box.

**But a refusal is not a dead end.** The lane still returns `quotableProviders` — every forwarder
selling it — so the client can open an RFQ against machinery that already exists rather than showing
the buyer a blank. This is §15.6's honest degradation applied to freight, and it is what Alibaba
actually does: no computed number for an unmeasured listing, and a route to a real quote instead.

**And the hole is closed at the source.** Publishing a listing now requires all five shipping facts
(§19.9a), so the unmeasured case shrinks to legacy listings rather than being the steady state.

### 19.9a The five shipping facts, and why not three

Publishing requires `packageLengthMm`, `packageWidthMm`, `packageHeightMm`,
`packageGrossWeightGrams` **and** `unitsPerPackage`.

**Three would not have been enough, and would have looked like enough.**
`computeConsignmentMeasurement` skips a line entirely when `unitsPerPackage` is null — volume is
box volume MULTIPLIED BY the package count — and `computePackagingTotals` skips it without a gross
weight. A dimensions-only gate would have passed listings that still contribute **zero volume and
zero weight** to the rater: a gate that looks done and is not.

**Required to publish, not to draft.** The columns stay nullable and there is no migration, because
nobody can invent a box size for a listing that already exists. A pre-Phase-20 listing keeps
selling; it is refused on its next edit, and `POST /products/:id/unpublish` stays ungated as the
escape hatch. The edit gate checks the **post-patch** values, so the patch is allowed to be the fix.

**One projection, two consumers.** `projectListingCompleteness` feeds both the publish refusal and
`PublicProduct.listingCompleteness`, so the checklist a seller sees on the form cannot disagree with
the 422 behind the button. It reuses §15.6's guided-pathway shape — per-item `state`, named missing
fields, a filled/required pair — rather than inventing a parallel vocabulary.

**Unconditional, because every listing is physical goods.** The browse taxonomy has had no services
or digital root since `0098` retired `digital_goods`. If a services category is ever seeded, this is
the requirement that has to become conditional.

### 19.9b The price is the provider's, structurally

Qatoto sells no freight (§0). So `FreightOption` does not carry a price — it carries a
**`providerQuote`**, and the money lives inside it beside `providerOrganizationId`,
`sourceForwarderName`, `validUntil` and `subjectToRemeasurement: true`.

**Nesting is the mechanism, not decoration.** A sibling `sourceForwarderName` is a field a renderer
can ignore; a price reachable only through the object that names its author is not. This is A13's
move — declared and measured stats in two objects so neither can be flattened into the other —
applied to the case where flattening would present a forwarder's rate as the platform's.

`FreightLanePlan.contracting.party` states `"provider"` **once**. Who the buyer contracts with is a
fact about the engagement, not about each row, and a constant repeated per option is a field
renderers learn to ignore.

`subjectToRemeasurement` is always `true` and is on the wire anyway: forwarders re-weigh and
re-measure at pickup and bill the result, so a rate computed from a seller's declaration is the
provider's estimate against that declaration and never a fixed charge.

---

### 19.10 The two admin reads — **SHIPPED, no migration**

Phase 20 shipped six admin writes and no admin read. `commerce-freight-rates.routes.ts` declared six
handlers and zero `router.get`, and its header stated the position outright: _"THE READS ARE NOT HERE
AND WILL NOT BE"_ — §19.5 extended the buyer-facing reads instead.

That position was right about the **buyer's** reads and wrong about the **operator's**. This section
is why, and what shipped.

#### Why an operator's read is not the same ask as a buyer's

**`POST` supersedes a live card silently.** The partial unique
`commerce_freight_rate_card_active_uidx` on
`(provider, origin, destination, mode, currency) WHERE state = 'active'` closes the incumbent, and the
response's `supersededRateCardId` is **the only place that is ever mentioned**. An operator who could
not list current coverage therefore replaced a live price without ever being told one existed — and
the one signal that it happened arrived after the fact, in the reply to the request that did it.

`commerce_customs_dwell_estimate_live_uidx` does the same for dwell, reported once as
`closedDwellEstimateId`.

This was not a convenience gap. §19.6's whole discipline is that a missing component is **named** and
never defaulted; a console that cannot name what it is about to overwrite is the same failure moved
one level up, from the price to the price list.

#### What their absence cost

Four of the six writes take an id the client had no route to discover:

| Write                                  | State before these reads                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /freight-rate-cards`             | Reachable. Needs no prior id                                           |
| `POST /freight-rate-cards/:id/breaks`  | Unreachable — and see the staging rule below, which narrows it further |
| `PATCH /freight-rate-cards/:id/breaks` | Unreachable — same                                                     |
| `PATCH /freight-rate-cards/:id`        | Unreachable. Yesterday's card could not be shortened or withdrawn      |
| `POST /customs-dwell-estimates`        | Reachable. Needs no prior id                                           |
| `PATCH /customs-dwell-estimates/:id`   | Unreachable. An estimate could not be retired                          |

So the console was buildable only as two create forms, and the lifecycle half of the surface — the
half that corrects a mistake — could not be built at all. That is why no client code was written for
it: a control wired to an id the operator has no way to obtain is unverified code, and this repo's own
audit exists to catch exactly that.

#### `GET /commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards`

Filters, all optional, camelCase keys: `originCountryCode`, `destinationCountryCode`, `mode`,
`providerOrganizationId`, `state`, `limit`, `cursor`. Enum values are sent **snake_case verbatim** —
`state` is `commerce_freight_rate_card_state` (`active` · `superseded` · `withdrawn`) and `mode` is
`commerce_shipment_leg_mode`, which has **four** members (`air` · `sea` · `land` · `rail`), not the
five of `freight_transport_mode`. A `.strict()` query schema means an unknown key is a `422` naming
it, so the console must not invent one — and must not read a `422` as "the filter is unsupported,
render everything".

Each row is the **existing `AdminFreightRateCard` projection** from `commerce-freight-rates.service.ts`
— the same object the six writes already answer with, `breaks` included and ordered by `position`. One
spelling per concept, in both directions of the exchange; a read-only variant of the shape would be a
second vocabulary to keep in sync.

Response: `{ items, page: { nextCursor, hasMore } }`, per §7. Order on `(validFrom DESC, id ASC)`.
`validFrom` rather than `createdAt`, which is what most lists here order on: a card's subject is the
day its prices start applying, so a card keyed in on Friday for next quarter belongs where an operator
looks for next quarter, not at the top because it was typed most recently. `id` last and ascending,
because two cards genuinely can share an instant — supersession sets a successor's `validFrom` to the
incumbent's `validUntil` — and a partial tiebreak drops whichever row loses it.

**Do not filter by `state` on the client.** The rating read's predicate is window-based, so a live
option may legitimately come from a `superseded` card; `state` is a filter the server applies, not a
display rule the console derives.

#### `GET /commerce/admin/customs-dwell-estimates`

Filters: `destinationCountryCode`, `originCountryCode`, `commodityScopeCategoryId`, `openOnly`,
`limit`, `cursor`. Rows are the existing `AdminCustomsDwellEstimate` projection. Same envelope, same
`(validFrom DESC, id ASC)` order. `openOnly=true` means `validUntil IS NULL` — the table has no
`state`, so an open window _is_ an unretired estimate. **`openOnly=false` narrows nothing** and is
identical to omitting the key; it is not a request for the retired rows. That is the `reviewable`
shape used elsewhere in commerce, and it is what unticking a checkbox means — a `false` that meant
"closed only" would leave no spelling for "show me everything". Retired-only, if ever wanted, wants
its own key.

`originCountryCode` and `commodityScopeCategoryId` are **nullable on the row and mean "any"** — the
create body already refuses omission and requires an explicit `null` for exactly this reason. A filter
that could not distinguish "scoped to any origin" from "not filtering by origin" would make the
any-origin rows unfindable, and those are the broadest claims the platform makes. So the two get
separate spellings: **the literal `any`** selects the NULL rows, a real code selects that code, and an
absent key narrows on nothing. `any` cannot collide with a real value — country codes are `^[A-Z]{2}$`
by column check as well as by schema.

Both reads take the same in-service `moderate_commerce` check as the writes, before any filter value
is read, for the reason §6.8 gives: a route-level guard makes the capability probeable from the route
table, and a filter-first service makes the read an oracle for which lanes and providers exist.
Neither takes an `Idempotency-Key` — a retried list changes nothing and has no body to key on. They
share a **separate** limiter from the writes, so paging a lane's history cannot spend the allowance the
operator then needs to fix what the page showed them.

#### The staging rule, which was written down nowhere else

`validFrom` is **optional on create and the controller defaults it to `new Date()`**, while
`assertCardAcceptsBreakWrites` refuses with `409 COMMERCE_FREIGHT_RATE_CARD_IN_FORCE` whenever
`validFrom <= now`. A card created without a `validFrom` is therefore in force the instant it exists,
and the two `/breaks` routes **can never succeed against it**.

The band-editing routes are reachable only on a card **staged** with a future `validFrom`. A console
built without knowing this ships two permanently-dead buttons, and an operator using one reads a
correct `409` as a broken page.

#### The design question this raised, and how it was settled

The two requirements above pull against each other. Rows must be the _existing_ projection — no
read-only variant, one vocabulary. But a list that cannot distinguish a staged card from one in force
hides the only property that decides which controls apply.

**Settled by putting `bandsEditable: boolean` on the shared projection**, computed as
`assertCardAcceptsBreakWrites(row, now) === null` — the same function the `409` comes from, not a
second opinion about it. Both directions of the exchange keep one shape, because the field is on the
shape both use: the six writes answer with it too.

The alternative — the console deriving `state === 'active' && validFrom > now` — was rejected. It puts
the deciding predicate in two codebases, and near `validFrom` the two disagree across ordinary clock
skew: the console enables a button and the very next request refuses it. §1.1's rule is that the
backend is the sole source of truth for anything gating a state transition, and "may these bands be
edited" is exactly that.

Two smaller consequences of the same reasoning:

- **`now` is a parameter of `projectRateCard`, not a clock read inside it**, and a list page computes
  one instant for every row. Two reads of the clock could straddle a `validFrom` and answer
  "editable" to the request that had just been refused.
- **The page fetches every band in one query**, keyed by the page's card ids, rather than calling
  `loadBreaksForCard` per row. Fifty cards at twenty bands is fifty round trips to save a `Map`. The
  per-card helper stays, because the write paths hold exactly one card.

#### What was deliberately not done

**No index.** Both are platform reference tables, staff-read only, at tens to low hundreds of rows,
where a scan and sort cost nothing; migrations here are hand-written, so an index is real cost against
no measurable gain. If `commerce_freight_rate_card` ever passes a few thousand rows,
`(valid_from DESC, id)` on each table is the change.

**No service-level test.** The route suite stubs the service wholesale, so what it proves is the
boundary — which query shapes get through, what the parsed object looks like, which refusal maps to
which status. The keyset and the single-query band fetch are exercised only against a real database.

---

### 19.11 Authoring the first card — **NO CODE, Phase 23**

Everything above says what the endpoints ENFORCE. This says what an operator must DO, in order,
and it exists because two of those rules are invisible until they have already cost a lane: a card
authored the obvious way can never have its bands edited, and a lane that looks fully loaded can
report nothing at all to every buyer who asks. Both are correct behaviour. Neither is discoverable
from a `409` or from an empty delivery sheet.

The tables ship **empty** and no seed fills them (§19.1, A36), so the first card on any lane is
authored by hand against these six routes.

#### The sequence

1. **`POST /commerce/admin/freight-rate-cards` with a FUTURE `validFrom`, and its bands in the same
   call.** `validFrom` is optional and the controller defaults it to `new Date()` — a defaulted card
   is IN FORCE THE INSTANT IT EXISTS, and `assertCardAcceptsBreakWrites` then refuses both `/breaks`
   routes on it forever with `409 COMMERCE_FREIGHT_RATE_CARD_IN_FORCE`. There is no unmaking that:
   `validFrom` is absent from every PATCH schema and `.strict()` refuses it, so a card staged wrong
   is withdrawn and rewritten, not corrected. `breaks` is required on create anyway (1..20, same
   transaction), so a correctly staged card is priced from its first instant.
2. **Confirm `bandsEditable: true` on the response.** It is the same predicate the `409` comes from,
   published on the projection every read and write returns. If it is `false`, the card is in force
   and step 3 cannot run.
3. **`POST`/`PATCH .../breaks` while it is still staged**, until the ladder is right.
4. **Author at least one band whose `minBillableWeightGrams` is `0`.** Without it every consignment
   lighter than the smallest band rates `below_smallest_break` and the lane publishes NO OPTION —
   which reaches the buyer as an empty delivery sheet, indistinguishable from having loaded no data
   at all. That refusal is deliberate (§19.9: a card whose smallest band starts at 45 kg is a tariff
   that says so), and it is why floor coverage is one reviewable row rather than a fallback.
5. **Author one `commerce_customs_dwell_estimate` row for the lane**, or the arrival window is
   `null` with customs named as the missing component (§19.4). A row scoped to neither origin nor
   commodity — both NULL, both meaning "any" — is the one that makes a lane answer at all; §19.3's
   precedence then lets a narrower row override it later. A DOMESTIC lane needs none: it has no
   customs leg, which is an absent component and not a zero-day one.
6. **Wait for `validFrom`.** The rating read selects on the window, never on `state = 'active'`, so
   the card starts pricing the moment its window opens with no further write.

#### The five sentinels an operator will see, and what each means for authoring

`unavailableReasons` is populated only when a lane produced no options at all, and every entry is
reported rather than defaulted (§19.6). Read as a checklist against the sequence above:

| Reason                       | What is actually missing                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no_active_rate_card`        | No card whose window is open on this lane, mode and currency. Step 1, or a `validFrom` still in the future |
| `card_has_no_breaks`         | A card exists with an empty ladder — only reachable by deleting bands, since create requires 1..20         |
| `below_smallest_break`       | Step 4. The card is loaded and the consignment is lighter than its smallest floor                          |
| `volume_not_declared`        | The consignment, not the card: a positive volume floor cannot be cleared by an undeclared volume           |
| `consignment_not_measurable` | The consignment again: no usable weight, so chargeable weight has no value                                 |

Only the first three are the author's to fix. The last two are a listing's shipping facts (§19.9a),
and a lane can be perfectly authored and still report them.

#### Two numbers that are wrong quietly rather than loudly

- **`volumetricDivisorCm3PerKg` is REQUIRED and per card**, because it varies by forwarder as well
  as by mode: ocean W/M 1000, road ~3000, air 5000–6000 (§19.9). It is bounded `BETWEEN 100 AND
20000`, which catches a decimal slip and nothing subtler — a road divisor typed onto an air card
  is inside the bound and will underbill every bulky consignment on that lane.
- **`unitPriceInCents` is CENTS PER KILOGRAM of chargeable weight** — not per consignment, and not
  per the band. The two `min*` columns are the band's ENTRY CONDITION, not its denominator. A
  forwarder's sheet quoting a flat lane price is entered as `minimumChargeInCents`, not as a
  `unitPriceInCents` that happens to look right at one weight.

#### What this section does not do

It makes the tables **authorable**, not **filled**. A36's commercial half stays open: forwarders
sell lane price lists, Qatoto has bought none, and until it does the freight surface answers
`no_active_rate_card` on every lane no matter how well this sequence is documented.

## Appendix A — What the frontend needs and this backend does not have

**Written from the other side.** §5 and §6 record what this backend serves. This records what the
store frontend tried to render and could not, found by reading all 33 `// TRANSPORT: mock` files in
`src/components/home/store/` against `src/db/schema.ts` and `src/routes/`.

**None of these blocked the frontend** — every one shipped as mock UI carrying a `TRANSPORT: mock`
banner, which is the point of writing them down. A stand-in nobody recorded becomes a bug report
later, and worse, becomes indistinguishable from an oversight.

Every absence below was confirmed by enumerating all 244 `pgTable` calls, not by spot-checking. The
sibling R&D appendix shipped one entry describing something already built; that is the failure mode
this list is written to avoid.

Each entry: **Needed by** · **What exists** · **What to build** · **Frontend today** · **Rule**.

---

### A1. Product variants — **SHIPPED (Phase 8)**

**Needed by:** `sections/product-color-picker.tsx`, a "Select Color" strip of four swatches.

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_variant` (product, name, `publicSlug`, `sku`, own price,
stock and MOQ, position, `active | retired`), plus `variantId` on `product_image`,
`product_pricing_tier`, `commerce_cart_product_line`, `commerce_inventory_reservation`,
`commerce_checkout_prepare_product_line` and `commerce_order_product_line` — the last two also
carrying `variantNameSnapshot`. Authored through `PUT /products/:id/variants`; projected on
`GET /store/products/:slug` as `variants[]`, with `hasVariants`/`variantCount` on the card.

**The rule that makes it safe:** a product has zero active variants (pre-Phase-8 behaviour,
unchanged) or one or more, and in the second case a cart line naming no variant is refused with
`VARIANT_REQUIRED`. Enforced in `commerce-pricing.ts` under the pricing row locks and again by
`commerce_cart_product_line_variant_guard`. A variant ladder replaces the product ladder rather
than merging with it, because tier prices are absolute unit prices.

**Rule, still binding:** a variant reaching an order line is snapshotted like every other
commercial fact — "Sea blue" is part of what was bought, so variants are retired, never deleted.

**Rule:** a variant reaching an order line must be snapshotted like every other commercial fact —
`commerce_order_product_line` records what was bought, and "Sea blue" is part of that.

---

### A2. Media kinds on `product_image` — **SHIPPED (Phase 8)**

**Needed by:** `sections/view-in-360-banner.tsx`.

**What exists now:** `mediaKind` (`photo | video | spin_360`, defaulting to `photo`, which is what
every pre-Phase-8 row is), `altText`, and `widthPx`/`heightPx` measured from the decoded bytes
rather than accepted from the client. Set through the multipart fields on
`POST /products/:id/images`.

**The unique index landed too**, as `(product_id, coalesce(variant_id, ''), position)` — an
expression index, because a per-variant gallery has its own position 0. Consequence worth knowing:
an expression index cannot be `DEFERRABLE`, so gallery re-packing parks every position beyond the
range before writing final ones. A per-row loop deadlocks against the index.

---

### A3. Specification grouping — **SHIPPED (Phase 8)**

**Needed by:** `sheets/product-details-sheet.tsx`, a tabbed spec sheet with five tabs and 28 rows.

**What exists:** `commerce_product_specification` is `{productId, specificationKey,
specificationValue, position}` — flat, unique on `(productId, specificationKey)`, no group, no unit.

**What exists now:** `specificationGroup`, free text like `roleLabel` in §15.2 — the useful
groupings for a chair and a transformer share nothing. The key stays unique per PRODUCT, not per
group: two groups claiming one key would make the sheet ambiguous about which value is current.
Authored through `PATCH /products/:id`, projected as `specifications[].group`.

---

### A4. `condition` in the public projection — **SHIPPED (Phase 8)**

**Needed by:** the PDP meta line, which showed "New / Refurbished / Used".

**What exists:** `product.condition` (`productConditionEnum`, notNull, default `new`) **is stored** —
it is simply absent from `StoreProductDetailProjection`.

**What exists now:** `condition` is on `StoreProductCardProjection`, so both the card and the
detail page carry it. It was the cheapest entry in the appendix and it was true — one select field
and one projection line.

---

### A5. Packaging dimensions and gross weight — **SHIPPED (Phase 8), REQUIRED TO PUBLISH (Phase 20)**

**Phase 20 update:** all five shipping facts are now required to PUBLISH a listing — the three
dimensions plus `packageGrossWeightGrams` and `unitsPerPackage`. Drafting stays free, the columns
stay nullable, and there is no migration: nobody can invent a box size for a listing that already
exists. See §19.9a for why three would not have been enough.

**Needed by:** `sections/packaging-and-delivery.tsx` (three spec rows plus three lead-time bands) and
the "In the box" line in `sections/product-details-section.tsx`.

**What exists:** `product.unitOfMeasure` (text, ≤40 chars) and the `leadTimeMinDays`/`leadTimeMaxDays`
pair. Weight and dimensions exist **only** on `commerce_shipment` (`packageCount`,
`totalWeightGrams`) — seller-entered at ship time, per shipment, not a product attribute.

**What exists now:** `packageLengthMm`, `packageWidthMm`, `packageHeightMm`,
`packageGrossWeightGrams` and `unitsPerPackage` on `product`, projected as a `packaging` object.
Dimensions are all-or-nothing — two of three is not a box — enforced by a Zod refinement and by
`product_package_dimensions_ck`. "In the box" remains best as a specification row under a reserved
group now that A3 has landed, not its own column.

**Rule, honoured:** integers in named units — millimetres and grams — never a formatted string. The
mock rendered "52 × 46 × 12 cm" and "4.8 kg" as prose, which cannot be filtered, compared, or
freight-rated. These columns are what A16 will rate freight from; they are not themselves a quote.

---

### A6. Product highlights — **SHIPPED (Phase 8)**

**Needed by:** `sections/product-highlights.tsx` — five collapsible cards, each `{title, body, image}`.

**What exists:** `product.keyFeatures: text[]`, documented in the schema as deliberately not a table:
short bullets with no image, no body, no identity.

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_highlight` (product, title, `bodyText`, `imageUrl`,
`position`), authored through `PUT /products/:id/highlights` and projected as `highlights[]`.
`product.keyFeatures` stays exactly what it was — the schema comment anticipated this split:
"promote to a table only if features ever grow attributes", and an image is an attribute.

---

### A7. Product-to-product relations — **SHIPPED (Phase 8)**

**Needed by:** `sheets/similar-products-sheet.tsx` (6 products), `sheets/compare-products-sheet.tsx`
(5 products, multi-select), and the two PDP recommendation rails.

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_relation`, specified in §15.3 — the first table in this
schema with two foreign keys to `product`, and the one that serves all five surfaces: companions,
similar, frequently-bought, compare candidates, and spare-part lookup from an order line.

Read it at `GET /store/products/:productSlug/companions`, grouped by `relationKind`, each companion
carrying `sourceKind` and a full product card. Written by the seller at
`PUT /commerce/products/:productId/relations` and promoted by staff at
`POST /commerce/admin/product-relations/:relationId/verify`.

**The rule §15.3 asked for, enforced:** `sourceKind` is not an input. A seller write is always
`seller_declared` regardless of body content, and `.strict()` turns an attempt to send
`moderator_curated` into a loud 422 rather than a silently ignored field. Only the platform
`moderate_commerce` capability promotes a claim, and a `commerce_product_relation_verified_ck`
constraint keeps reviewer attribution and `moderator_curated` in lockstep in both directions.

**Shipped since:** the nightly `derive-product-relations` co-occurrence job (§15.9, Phase 9) now
writes `derived_cooccurrence` rows, which nothing produced when the source kind first shipped.

**Still absent:** ranking and recommendation _selection_ (Phase 10+).

---

### A8. Reviews are write-only — **SHIPPED (Phase 10)**

**Needed by:** `sections/ratings-and-reviews.tsx` — a rating summary, three sub-score bars (Service,
Shipping, Quality), a video strip, a photo strip, filter and sort chips, and review cards with
images, helpful counts and a seller reply.

**What exists:** `commerce_review` — `{completionId, reviewerOrganizationId, subjectOrganizationId,
productId, rating 1–5, body, visibility}`. `POST /commerce/completions/:completionId/reviews` is the
**only** review route in the codebase. There is no read endpoint anywhere, so a review can be written
and never seen. Aggregates (`averageRating`, `reviewCount`) are the only thing that surfaces.

**What exists now:** all five, in that order.
`GET /store/products/:productSlug/reviews` and `GET /store/organizations/:organizationSlug/reviews`
carry four sorts, a rating filter and a `hasMedia` filter over five partial keyset indexes; plus
`commerce_review_media`, `commerce_review_score`, `commerce_review_vote` and
`commerce_review_reply` (whose `reviewId` IS the primary key, so a second reply is
unrepresentable rather than merely rejected).

The organization route is not padding: `commerce_review.productId` is nullable because a
service-engagement completion has no product, so reviews of a freight forwarder were unreachable
from anywhere.

**Review video is a YouTube link, not an upload** — this codebase has no first-party video ingest,
and `mediaKind` discriminates the two supply shapes rather than making every column nullable.

**The summary is computed over every visible review in scope, never the filtered subset.** The
filter chips display those counts; a summary that narrowed with the filter would renumber the
chips as you click them.

**Rule:** the verified-purchase badge is already earned structurally — a review requires a
`completionId`, so it cannot exist without a completed order. Keep it that way; never add a
free-floating review.

---

### A9. Product Q&A — **SHIPPED (Phase 10)**

**Needed by:** `sections/questions-and-answers.tsx`.

**What exists:** nothing for products. The only threaded primitives are `video_comment` (video domain)
and `commerce_thread`/`commerce_message` (private, RFQ/quote-scoped). §12 Phase 7 already lists Q&A
as deferred.

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_question` and `commerce_product_answer`, post-moderated
through A12. A question carries **no organization column** — it is asked by a person, and
snapshotting the asker's employer publishes it, which is a §14-shaped disclosure Q&A does not need
to make.

**`authorKind` is derived, never sent.** A seller answer is bound by trigger to the organization
that owns the product; a verified-buyer answer must cite a `commerce_completion` for that product
and that organization, so the badge is earned structurally exactly as A8 demands of reviews.
Refusing a caller with neither standing is also what stops Q&A quietly becoming A10.

---

### A10. Product comments — **CLOSED, NOT BUILT (Phase 13)**

**Needed by:** `sheets/comment-sheet.tsx` and `sheets/product-comment-thread.tsx`.

**What exists:** nothing. The sheet imports `Comment`, `Reply` and `Review` from
`src/types/video.ts` — the **video** domain's types, reused verbatim on a commerce surface.

**DECIDED IN PHASE 13: NOT BUILT, AND THE ENTRY IS CLOSED.** Public comments on a B2B listing
are the wrong primitive where Q&A (A9), reviews (A8) and private inquiries (A14) already exist.
All three require standing — a review needs a `completionId`, an answer needs a seller
relationship or a verified purchase, an inquiry needs an authenticated buyer organization — and
a free-floating comment would be the only public text surface on a listing with no purchase
proof and no standing requirement behind it. That is precisely what A9 was shaped to avoid
becoming.

Neither reference market disagrees: Alibaba gives buyers reviews, Q&A and private chat and
nothing free-floating, and Amazon removed customer comments from product pages in 2020 because
they were unmoderatable and carried no purchase proof.

The mock sheets should be deleted rather than left implying scheduled work.

**Rule:** whatever ships, it does not reuse video comment types. Two domains sharing a row shape by
accident is how a change to one silently breaks the other.

---

### A11. Engagement counters — **SHIPPED (Phase 10)**

**Needed by:** `sections/engagement-bar.tsx` — comment 1.1k, favourite 3.7k, bookmark 414, share 3696.

**What exists:** nothing for products. Every counter in the codebase is video-domain (`video_stats`,
`video_save`, `video_share`, `video_like`).

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_engagement` (per-USER save/bookmark rows),
`commerce_product_share`, and `commerce_product_stats` for the counters, with
`engagement.viewer.hasLiked` / `hasBookmarked` on the product read.

**THE HEART AND THE BOOKMARK ARE DIFFERENT FACTS (migration 0120).** They shipped as `saved` and
`bookmarked` — two names for one behaviour — and `GET /commerce/saved-products` returned BOTH when
`kind` was absent, so a heart tap filed a product in the buyer's wishlist exactly as a bookmark did.
They are now split on meaning:

- **`liked`** is a PUBLIC COUNTER and nothing else. It is never listed back to the person who made
  it, there is no "products you liked" surface, and it earns no ranking points anywhere.
- **`bookmarked`** IS the wishlist, and is the only kind `GET /commerce/bookmarked-products`
  returns. That route takes **no `kind` parameter** — the query schema is `.strict()`, so a stale
  client still sending one gets a 422 rather than a quietly different list.

**The ranking reads bookmarks, never likes.** All four places the ranking touches this table count
`engagement_kind = 'bookmarked'`: the nightly `commerce_product_daily_signal.bookmarks` rollup,
`bookmarks_w1`, `distinct_bookmarkers_w1` — the whole buyer-engagement component — and the
subnet-concentration guard. A like is one tap with no purchase intent behind it and is trivially
farmable. `COMMERCE_TRENDING_ALGORITHM_VERSION` went to **2** with the switch, so version-1
snapshots measured a different gesture and must not be compared with version-2 ones.

**User-scoped, not organization-scoped**, and the reason is `commerce_organization.tradeState`: it
starts `pending` and only a staff decision makes it `active`, so an org-keyed bookmark would put a
single tap behind human verification, flicker for a user in several organizations, and let any
`viewer`-role colleague empty the team's list. The real B2B need — a named, owned, permissioned
sourcing shortlist — is its own object and is not delivered here.

**`viewer` is `null` for an anonymous caller**, not `{hasLiked: false}`: "not liked" and "we do not
know who you are" are different facts. And **`commentCount` is absent**, because A10 has no table
and a hardcoded zero is precisely the A13 failure this list exists to avoid.

**Frontend today:** both toggles are wired and write the server's returned counters straight into
cache — nothing is optimistic. `useToggleProductBookmarked` invalidates the wishlist query;
`useToggleProductLiked` deliberately does not, because a like changes no list. Both buttons carry an
`aria-label`, which they did not while the two gestures meant the same thing.

**Rule:** counts are integers on the wire. The mock renders "3.7k" and "8.8m" as strings — the client
formats, the server counts.

---

### A12. Content reports — **SHIPPED (Phase 10)**

**Needed by:** the PDP's "Report abuse" row.

**What exists:** one report table, `research_program_content_report`, whose target CHECK admits only
R&D posts and papers. Nothing targets a product, review, organization or message. `moderationState`
on a product is moderator-set with no user-submitted row behind it.

**This entry's plan was wrong, and the correction shipped with it.** Commerce reports cannot feed
`content_review_action`: its `videoId` is NOT NULL with a cascade to `video`. Generalizing that
table would also merge two queues gated by DIFFERENT capabilities — `moderate_content` and
`moderate_commerce` — into one, the coupling capabilities exist to prevent. R&D already built its
own `research_program_moderation_action` rather than reuse it.

**What exists now:** `commerce_content_report` with five nullable foreign keys and an XOR check
(the wire still takes one `targetId`), and a parallel `commerce_moderation_action`.
`POST /commerce/reports` plus four `/commerce/admin/*` routes.

**Post-moderation needed a griefing answer.** Only user-authored content auto-hides, at three
distinct open reporters counted in the report's own transaction; a product or organization never
does, because delisting is a commercial action requiring a human. Dismissing restores an
auto-hide.

**`actionSource` exists because `platform_audit_entry.actorUserId` is NOT NULL.** An automatic hide
names nobody, so rather than weaken the hash chain it is recorded with no moderator and no audit
entry, bound by a check in both directions.

**Frontend today:** a `<span>` reading "Report abuse (coming later)" — deliberately not a link.

---

### A13. There is no seller profile table — **SHIPPED (Phase 12)**

**Needed by:** `sections/company-details-section.tsx` (six stats, rating, main categories, four
capabilities), `sheets/company-details-sheet.tsx` (founded, location, business type, four factory
photos, four freight-access rows, visit policy, two stakeholders) and
`sheets/verified-capabilities-sheet.tsx` (four capabilities, five certifications).

**What existed:** `commerce_organization` — **16 columns**, none of them profile depth.
`commerce_provider_profile` exists but is keyed to _service providers_; a manufacturer selling
products had no profile row at all. Of the six mock stats:

| Stat                                   | Before Phase 12                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| On-time delivery rate                  | **projected but always `null`** — `commerce-trust-metrics.service.ts:98` said it "stays null until promised-delivery timestamps exist", and no such column existed |
| Completed orders                       | real, derived                                                                                                                                                      |
| Response time                          | existed for **providers only**, and was a manually-entered integer, not measured                                                                                   |
| Year founded · Collaborating factories | did not exist                                                                                                                                                      |
| Online revenue                         | does not exist — and see §14                                                                                                                                       |
| Reorder rate                           | did not exist                                                                                                                                                      |

**What exists now:** all of it except online revenue, which stays §14's decision.
`commerce_seller_profile`, `commerce_organization_media`, `commerce_organization_site_access`,
`commerce_organization_stakeholder`, `commerce_organization_capability` and
`commerce_organization_certification`, authored through ten routes on
`commerce-seller-profile.routes.ts`; plus `promised_delivery_at` on the order and its product lines,
`lead_time_max_days_snapshot` on the prepare line, and `reorderRate` /
`measuredResponseTimeHours` derived in `commerce-trust-metrics.service.ts`.

**Item 6's plan was wrong, and the correction shipped with it.** Certifications cannot ride
`commerce_organization_verification`: `commerce_organization_verification_pending_uidx` is unique on
`(organizationId, verificationKind)` where pending, so an organization could hold exactly ONE pending
certificate, and a supplier has ISO 9001 and CE and RoHS and BSCI. It has no name, issuer, standard
or expiry column either, so an approved row could not say what it certifies or when it lapses — and
the platform would publish lapsed certificates indefinitely. A parallel table ships instead, the same
call `commerce_content_report` made in Phase 10.

**Item 1 understated the chain.** "A promised-delivery timestamp on the shipment or order line" needs
THREE tables, because `confirmCheckout` builds each order line verbatim from the prepare row — the
constraint A18 had to route around. The seller's advertised lead time is snapshotted at preparation
and the promise derived at confirm, because a seller typing a date at ship time would set the bar
after knowing the outcome, and re-reading the product at confirm would hold it to a lead time the
buyer never saw.

**Expiry is deliberately not a certification state.** Lapsing is `validUntil < current_date` at read
time; a stored `expired` value would need a nightly job and would be wrong between ticks, which is
the exact failure this entry exists to prevent.

**Rule, and it is the whole point of splitting this list — now enforced structurally:** a derived
stat and a declared stat must be visibly different on the wire. "98.6% on-time, measured across 412
completed orders" and "founded 2009, per the seller" are different kinds of claim, and a projection
that flattens them into one `stats: {label, value}[]` array — which is exactly the mock's shape —
teaches the UI to present a seller's assertion as a platform measurement. The storefront and provider
reads therefore carry **two objects**, `declaredProfile` and `measuredMetrics`, and the flattening is
unavailable rather than merely discouraged.

**Found on the way in:** `PublicProviderCard` had been shipping `averageResponseTimeHours` — an
integer a provider types about itself — as a flat sibling of the platform-derived
`fulfillmentMetrics.onTimeShipmentRate` since Phase 2. That is this entry's own rule being violated
by live code. It is now `declaredResponseTimeHours`, and the measured median lives under
`measuredMetrics`.

**Every rate is `null` below its sample threshold and ships its sample size.** "100% on-time across
three orders" is not a performance claim, and a bare `1.0` is indistinguishable from an earned one.
The thresholds themselves stay off the wire.

---

### A14. Threads from a product — **SHIPPED (Phase 10)**

**Needed by:** `sections/store-and-chat-actions.tsx` — the PDP's "Chat now" button.

**What exists:** `commerce_thread_resource_kind` has five values, but
`POST /commerce/threads` accepts only `rfq | quote`. A buyer looking at a product has nothing to open.

**Widening to `product` would have been a cross-tenant leak.** `commerce_thread_resource_uidx` is
unique on `(resourceKind, resourceId)`, so a thread keyed on the product id is ONE THREAD PER
PRODUCT ACROSS ALL BUYERS — `assertThreadParticipant` would admit every buyer organization that
ever inquired and hand each of them every other buyer's negotiation.

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_inquiry` is the resource the thread points at, so the unique
index is correct unmodified — one thread per inquiry, one inquiry per (product, buyer
organization) — and `commerce_message` is untouched. `POST /commerce/products/:productId/inquiries`
and `GET /commerce/inquiries`, with `convertedToRfqId` recording a conversion as a POINTER: an RFQ
thread holds every invited provider, so merging a one-to-one pre-sales chat into it would show one
seller's conversation to its competitors.

**The rule, resolved rather than dodged:** the gate stays, and A9 shipped first so the buyer who
cannot clear it is not dead-ended. The product read states which control to offer through
`contactAffordance: "chat" | "ask_question" | "sign_in"` — a fact about the caller, which the
caller already knows.

---

### A15. Delivery addresses — **SHIPPED (Phase 11)**

**Needed by:** `sections/deliver-to.tsx` and `sheets/address-sheet.tsx` — select, add and edit a
delivery address, capped at five.

**What was wrong, and it was the most serious gap in the list:**

- `commerceOrganizationAddressKindEnum` is `billing | registered | warehouse | pickup | return`.
  **There is no `delivery` or `shipping` kind.**
- `assertOwnedDeliveryAddress` in `commerce-checkout.service.ts` filters on id + organization and
  **does not filter on `addressKind` at all** — any address of any kind can be a delivery address.
- The snapshot persisted onto the order is built from **plaintext columns only** — country, region,
  locality, postal code. Street lines, recipient name and phone are encrypted and never make it in.
  **A confirmed order therefore records a city and a postcode, not an address anything can ship to.**
- There is no user-scoped address table anywhere; addresses belong to organizations.

**What exists now:** a `delivery` address kind, a kind filter in `assertOwnedDeliveryAddress` with
its own `ADDRESS_KIND_INVALID` tag, a durable `commerce_order.delivery_address_id`, a server-owned
cap of ten addresses per kind, and the decrypt path §14 decided on —
`GET /commerce/orders/:orderId/delivery-address`, gated on order membership, a
counterparty-operating role and an order state at or past `confirmed`.

**The rule that makes it safe:** the audit entry is written to the BUYER's stream, and if it cannot
be written the read rolls back. `delivery_address_revealed` is the first READ event in an audit
enum whose other fifty values all record writes — which is the whole reason a decrypt path beats a
seller-openable snapshot. The order snapshot stays redacted; this route is the only way past it.

**Found on the way in:** `createAddress`'s audit payload used the key `addressKind`, which the
guard's PII-name regex matches on `address`, so the append failed, the transaction rolled back, and
`POST /commerce/organizations/:id/addresses` had been failing at runtime for every caller. The route
suite mocks the service, so nothing caught it.

**Frontend today:** two hardcoded addresses in `useState` that evaporate on unmount.

---

### A16. Indicative delivery estimates — **SHIPPED (Phase 11)**

**Needed by:** `sections/delivery-cost.tsx` ("Free Delivery", "Sept 23 to Sept 27") and
`sheets/delivery-sheet.tsx` (per-leg mode picker with prices and durations, agent alternatives, a
running estimate).

**What exists:** `shippingInCents` is a real money column on four totals tables, each with a CHECK
that `total = subtotal + tax + serviceFee + shipping - discount`. In the checkout path it is written
as **literal `0`** — `commerce-checkout.service.ts:499` and `:788` — alongside `taxInCents: 0` and
`serviceFeeInCents: 0`. The only way a non-zero value enters is a seller typing one onto a quote.
There is no rate table, no carrier call, no distance or weight estimator, no delivery-date estimator.

**What exists now:** `commerce-delivery-estimate.service.ts`, assembling a per-currency range from
`commerce_service_coverage` and `commerce_service_offering` against the Phase 8 package geometry —
the columns whose schema comment already said freight rating was the whole reason they exist, and
which nothing had read since. Surfaced on `checkout/prepare` as `deliveryEstimates` and at
`GET /store/products/:productSlug/delivery-estimate`.

**Rule, honoured:** an estimate is not a quote. No delivery DATE is returned at all, currencies are
never converted, every estimate carries the offerings it was derived from, and a seller who never
declared package geometry produces `hasIncompletePackageData: true` rather than a guessed weight.
An uncovered route returns an **empty array, not a zero** — "we do not know" and "it is free" are
different answers, and the mock rendered the second one.

**`shippingInCents` is still `0`, and that is now the decision rather than the gap.** Nothing is
charged for freight, so nothing appears in a total; billing from an advertised price range with no
booking behind it would put an invented number into an immutable order.

---

### A17. Sample ordering — **SHIPPED (Phase 11)**

**Needed by:** `sections/sample-price.tsx` — "Sample price: $1,410/set" and a "Get sample" button.

**What exists:** `product.samplePolicy` (`unavailable | paid | refundable`),
`product.samplePriceInCents`, a CHECK binding them, a facet, and both fields on the public
projection. It is fully modelled **as an advertisement**.

**What exists now:** `is_sample` on the cart line, prepare line, order line and inventory
reservation, with all three uniqueness indexes rewritten to carry it — a buyer holding a sample AND
a bulk line of one product is the entire pattern samples exist for. Sample pricing bypasses
**exactly two things**, the tier ladder and the minimum order quantity, because both express bulk
economics and a sample is the negation of bulk; purchasability, the variant rules and stock all
still apply.

`commerce_sample_credit` is what finally makes `refundable` mean something: minted once when a
refundable sample order completes, spent whole against the same seller in the same currency as
`discountInCents`, resolved under the confirm row lock rather than from what the prepare displayed.
It needs no journal change — the discount lands before a payment intent exists, so no cross-order
money movement is invented.

**Frontend today:** a hardcoded price string and a handler-less button. Note the PDP renders the
**real** `samplePolicy` and `samplePriceInCents` a few lines above it, so the mock row currently
contradicts the wire.

---

### A18. Customization options — **SHIPPED (Phase 11)**

**Needed by:** `sections/customization-options.tsx` and `sheets/customization-sheet.tsx` — four upload
slots, each with its own accepted file types and minimum order quantity, plus a packaging-material
choice with its own minimums.

**What exists:** nothing. The only "packaging" in the schema is a member of the R&D
`supplierCapabilityKindEnum`, unrelated to `product` or `commerce_organization`.

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_customization_option` (upload and choice kinds, accepted
media types, choice values, per-slot minimum order quantity, required flag), authored at
`PUT /products/:id/customization-options` and retired rather than deleted — an order line
references the option it was bought under. Selections ride **three** tables, cart to prepare to
order, because `confirmCheckout` builds an order line verbatim from the prepare row and never
re-reads the cart.

**Rule, enforced:** the per-slot minimum order quantity is a commercial term, checked at cart and
again at checkout preparation. Required slots are mandatory only at preparation — a buyer may build
a cart before uploading artwork, but may not confirm an order missing what the seller declared
required.

Artwork uploads at `POST /commerce/customization-assets` as a private encrypted document with the
verification-evidence middleware's magic-byte check, lands `pending_scan`, and **cannot be attached
until a scanner promotes it** — upload completion is not a malware verdict.

---

### A19. Merchandising data-integrity gaps — **SHIPPED (Phase 8)**

All four were small, cheap, and each one let a bad row exist. All four are closed:

- **Hero-slide link targets are all-or-nothing.** `store_hero_slide_link_target_ck` requires
  `linkTargetKind`, `linkTargetId` and `linkTargetSlug` together or not at all, so the frontend's
  defensive "require both before building an href" is now a guarantee rather than a guess.
  Migration `0054` preflights this and refuses to run against violating rows.
- **`product_image` position is unique**, as `(product_id, coalesce(variant_id, ''), position)` —
  see A2 for why it is an expression index and what that costs re-packing.
- **`category` and `organization` merchandising placements now resolve.**
  `MerchandisingItemProjection` gained both members and
  `resolveEligibleMerchandisingItems` resolves them through
  `resolveEligibleCategoriesByIds` / `resolveEligibleOrganizationCardsByIds`, using the same
  public-eligibility rules products and offerings already used. Placing something and seeing
  nothing rendered, with no error, was the worst of the four.
- **`store_pathway_item` carries `startsAt`/`endsAt`** and the pathway read filters on the window,
  matching `store_rail_placement` since Phase 1 (§15.2). Phase 9 carried the window onto
  `store_pathway_slot` and retired the item table from every read path.

---

### A20. Blocked, not backlogged

Two things the frontend mocks that must **not** become backend work until a decision exists — they
belong in §14:

- **Trade protection.** `sections/trade-protection.tsx` and its sheet already render four guarantees
  in finished copy — "funds are only released once the order is confirmed", "full refund — no
  back-and-forth". §4.9 and §14 both forbid claiming custody Qatoto does not have. The frontend keeps
  this mock **hidden behind a decision**, not scheduled.
- **Supplier revenue disclosure.** "Online revenue US $2.4M+" is a seller's commercial secret. Even
  once derivable from order data, publishing it needs explicit seller consent and a policy — see the
  new §14 entry.

---

### A21. Seller-supplied image URLs — **SHIPPED (`0090`–`0091`)**

**Not found from the frontend side.** This entry came from auditing §11 against the code: "Normalize
and allowlist external URLs before storage" was a rule nothing implemented.

**What was wrong.** Five columns took a bare client-supplied https string, validated only by
`startsWith('https://')` and a 2048 cap — `commerce_product_highlight.image_url`,
`commerce_organization_stakeholder.photo_url`, `commerce_organization.logo_url`, and
`store_pathway.hero_image_url` / `card_image_url`. The store rendered all five on public surfaces.

Three consequences, and the third is the one that decided it:

1. **EXIF is never stripped.** `commerce_organization_media` had already departed from this
   precedent for exactly that reason — and its schema comment names two of these columns as the
   precedent it was departing FROM. A stakeholder portrait is the stronger case than the factory
   photo that argument was written for: the coordinates belong to the person.
2. **The seller's origin sees every store visitor's IP and user agent** — a tracking channel the
   platform grants without knowing it.
3. **The bytes stay mutable after moderation.** §15.5 lets a seller PROPOSE a pathway; a moderator
   publishes it; `EDITABLE_PATHWAY_STATES` then freezes the row, so the store presents the art as
   reviewed. It reviewed a URL. Approving a pointer is not approving a picture.

**What exists now.** Each image carries the triple `commerce_organization_media` established — a
Cloudinary public id, plus width and height measured from the decoded bytes — behind four multipart
routes: `POST /products/:id/highlights/:highlightId/image`,
`POST /commerce/organizations/:id/stakeholders/:stakeholderId/photo`,
`POST /commerce/organizations/:id/logo`, and `POST /commerce/pathways/:id/images/:imageSlot`. Every
URL input was removed from its JSON body, so `.strict()` turns a client still sending one into a
loud 422 rather than a silently ignored field.

**Two things the plan for this did not anticipate.** **Highlights and stakeholders were wholesale
replace-lists** — delete-all-then-insert — so an image attached to a child id would have been
orphaned by the next edit to its own title. Both are now identity-preserving in the shape
`replaceProductVariants` already used, with positions parked beyond the incoming range because
`(parent, position)` is unique. A client-supplied id is a **hint, never a grant**: it is honoured
only when it already belongs to that parent, so naming another seller's row cannot move or read it.
And **legacy hotlinks are left in place**, rendering, with a NULL public id — nulling them would
blank live storefronts, and re-fetching them inside a DDL transaction would make the migration
itself an SSRF surface. The CHECKs keep the two shapes distinguishable rather than merged.

**Found on the way in, unrelated to images:** `product_image.media_kind` offered `video`, but
`addProductImage` re-encodes every upload to AVIF and the table has no video URL column, so a
`video` row was a still wearing a label it could not honour. Migration `0090` narrowed the enum to
`photo | spin_360`. Product video, if ever wanted, follows A8's shape — an external YouTube id under
a supply CHECK — because this codebase has no first-party video ingest.

**Still hotlinked, deliberately:** `store_hero_slide.image_url` and `commerce_category.image_url`
are staff-authored, so the platform chooses the host. `commerce_organization.website_url` is a link
a buyer chooses to follow, not bytes the store renders on the seller's behalf.

---

### A22. Reviews were unreachable — **SHIPPED (`0092`)**

**Not a missing feature — a missing door.** Everything A8 specified shipped in Phase 10: a 1–5
rating under `commerce_review_rating_ck`, sub-scores, Cloudinary review photos, YouTube review
video, helpful votes, seller replies, and a public read with a summary histogram.

**None of it could be reached.** `POST /commerce/completions/:completionId/reviews` is keyed on a
`completionId`, and `completionId` was projected on **no** read in this backend.
`commerce_completion` was queried only by `commerce-product-qa.service.ts` (a `LIMIT 1`
verified-buyer probe) and `commerce-trust-metrics.service.ts` (aggregates). No route listed
completions for any actor. A buyer could obtain the id only by guessing a UUID, so the entire
review surface was live, constrained, rate-limited — and dead.

**What exists now:** `GET /commerce/completions`, buyer-scoped and cursor-paginated, each row
carrying `hasReview`; plus `completionId` on every order product line and `completionIds` on the
order detail, so a buyer arriving from an order does not have to page a second endpoint.

Three things worth carrying forward.

**`hasReview` is a fact about the CALLER, not the completion.** It is derived from
`commerce_review_completion_reviewer_uidx` scoped to the caller's organization — another
organization's review must never make a completion look spent. That index carries no partial
predicate, so a `visibility = 'hidden'` review still blocks a second one, and `hasReview` counts
hidden reviews for exactly that reason: reporting `false` would offer the client a write
`createReview` refuses.

**`reviewable=true` filters in SQL, not over the fetched page.** A post-filter would return short
pages and compute the next cursor from rows it had just dropped, so the following page would start
past rows the caller never saw — a pagination bug that presents as missing data rather than as an
error. It is a correlated `NOT EXISTS` in the same `WHERE`.

**The order read is NOT scoped to the reader.** `getOrder` admits both the buyer and the
counterparty, and filtering completion ids by the reader would hand the seller an order whose lines
claim no completion exists. A completion id is not a capability — `evaluateReviewRelationship`
refuses anyone but the buyer — so both parties see the same honest projection.

Migration `0092` adds `(buyer_organization_id, completed_at DESC, id)`;
`commerce_completion_buyer_idx` stops at `completed_at` and cannot serve §7's tie-break. Correctness
never depended on it — that lives in the keyset predicate — and the old index is kept for the range
reads `commerce-trust-metrics` does.

**Corrected while here:** `attachReviewVideo`'s docblock credited "the shipped
`verify-youtube-video` oEmbed job" with checking whether a review's video exists. That job reads the
`video` table alone and has never touched `commerce_review_media`, so a well-formed id pointing at a
deleted or private video is stored and rendered indefinitely. The comment now says so.

**That last note is CLOSED in Phase 23; see A40.** The design it recorded — a dead video hides its
media row and leaves the review standing, because a buyer's testimony must not be deleted when a
third-party host removes a file — is what `0117`/`0118` built, and
`revalidate-youtube-embeds` is what decides. A40 also records what the decision cost, which this
entry could not have predicted: `media_count` had to start counting VISIBLE media, and three
writers were still reading it as a count of attached rows.

### A23. Customization options had no buyer read — **SHIPPED (Phase 15)**

**Needed by:** `sections/customization-options.tsx` (four upload slots) and
`sheets/customization-sheet.tsx` (per-slot accepted file types and minimum order quantity, plus the
packaging-material choice).

**What was wrong.** All of A18's write side shipped and none of its read. The option list was
projected only on the SELLER's own `GET /products/:id` — and in fact not even there, because
`loadOrganizationProduct` never selected the table, so `PUT /products/:id/customization-options`
could not read back what it had just written.

**Which made it worse than a missing feature.** A18's rule is that required slots are mandatory at
preparation. A buyer was never told the slot existed, so a product carrying a required customization
option **could not be checked out by anybody** — `checkout/prepare` refused an order for a term the
buyer had no way to read.

**What exists now:** `customizationOptions[]` on `StoreProductDetailProjection`, carrying `slotKey`,
kind, accepted media types, choice values, `minimumOrderQuantity`, `isRequired` and position, active
options only; and `ProductCustomizationOptionView[]` on the seller's `PublicProduct`, which does
carry `state` so a retired slot does not look deleted. No migration — the data was always there.

**Rule, still binding:** a term checked at preparation must be readable before preparation. Any gate
the buyer cannot see is a defect, not a policy. The buyer wire carries no `state`, because the read
is active-only and a retired option is not a thing a buyer can choose.

---

### A24. Q&A answers could not be voted on, and review votes had no viewer state — **SHIPPED (`0093`)**

**Needed by:** `sections/questions-and-answers.tsx` (like/dislike per answer, plus a flag) and
`sections/ratings-and-reviews.tsx` (the helpful toggle on each review card).

**Two absences, both closed.** `commerce-product-qa.service.ts` had **no vote table and no vote
route at all** — A9 shipped questions, answers, derived `authorKind` and post-moderation, and
nothing that ranks or endorses an answer. And per-viewer vote state was missing from the public
review read, which A22 recorded as an absence without carrying it into a build item.

**Why the viewer state was a read gap rather than a nicety.** A toggle whose own state needs a
second authenticated call renders wrong on first paint and then corrects itself, which reads as a
bug and teaches a buyer that the count is not to be trusted. It is the same call A11 made with
`engagement.viewer` and A22 made with `hasReview`: a fact about the CALLER belongs on the read the
caller already made.

**What exists now:** `commerce_product_answer_vote` — `commerce_review_vote` byte for byte, keyed on
`(answerId, voterOrganizationId)` with row presence as the vote — plus `helpful_count` on the
answer, a partial helpful index, and `commerce_product_answer_vote_relationship_guard`, which
refuses an author's vote on its own answer and a member id borrowed from another organization.
`PUT`/`DELETE /commerce/answers/:answerId/helpful` take the review pair's shape exactly: no
idempotency and no `compactBody`, because PUT and DELETE of a boolean are idempotent by verb. Both
public reads gained `viewer`, and `loadTopAnswers` now breaks its tie on `helpfulCount` **behind**
the seller-first rank — the paginated answer read keeps its plain `createdAt` keyset, because a
cursor over a computed rank is how pagination starts skipping rows.

**Rule, still binding:** votes are integers on the wire and per-viewer state is a nullable object,
never a defaulted `false` for an anonymous caller. `null` here also means "you cannot vote", because
both vote tables are keyed on the organization rather than the user.

---

### A25. Search could not find an organization, and its filters were thinner than its own facets — **SHIPPED (`0095`)**

**Needed by:** the store's "Factories worldwide" tile, the `/store/providers` sibling a buyer
expects for manufacturers, and `STORE_STRUCTURE.md` §7.3's filter list.

**Three gaps, and the first two were the same mistake.** A seller organization was **not a search
document**, so there was no supplier directory: a buyer could reach one storefront by slug and could
not browse or filter sellers at all, while service providers had both a directory and a detail page.
The query schema omitted every facet the platform already computes — price range, `stockState`,
`samplePolicy` — plus lead-time range, `condition` and verification state. And `getCategoryBySlug`
returned `{category, children}` with **no ancestor trail**, so a breadcrumb over a nested category
needed one request per level.

**Why the second one mattered more than it looked.** A facet the backend computes and the search
cannot filter on is an invitation to filter the fetched page, which is precisely §2.4's prohibition.
The facet counts were already the honest denominator; only the `WHERE` clause was missing.

**What exists now:** an `organization` member on `storeSearchDocumentKindEnum`, written by
`refreshOrganizationSearchDocument` under the same public-eligibility rule products answer to
(`tradeState = 'active' AND visibility = 'public'`), carrying the legal name and the category names
it sells into so "cold chain" finds the manufacturer and not only the freezer. Five denormalized
columns — `stock_state` (its own enum, matching `deriveStockState`'s four values), `sample_policy`,
`condition`, `provider_verification_state`, `lead_time_max_days` — behind seven new
`.strict()` query keys. And `ancestors[]` on the category read, root first, from an upward recursive
CTE that STOPS at the first inactive ancestor rather than skipping it: a trail with a hole in it
renders as a path whose middle link goes nowhere.

**Two rules this settled.** A NULL facet is **excluded** by these filters, not admitted —
`minOrderQuantityMax` admits NULL because "no MOQ declared" satisfies "MOQ at most 50", but a
document with no stock state is not a document that is in stock. And the denormalized `stock_state`
is **variant-aware**, matching `mapProductCard`, because a card and a filter now read the same
column and disagreeing would be the worse bug.

**Rule, still binding:** a filter and its facet are one concept and ship together. Publishing a
count the caller cannot act on is worse than publishing neither. **The half this entry left open —
`getCategoryFacets` aggregating over `product` while the filters read `store_search_document` — is
CLOSED in Phase 22; see A39.** It was not the drift risk this entry described but a live
disagreement, and A39 also closes the same rule pointing the other way: six filters that had no
count at all.

---

### A26. Variants are a flat list, not attribute axes — **DEFERRED, deliberately**

**Needed by:** the PDP's "Select Color" swatch strip only if it ever grows a second dimension.

**What exists:** A1's `commerce_product_variant` — `name`, `publicSlug`, `sku`, own price, stock and
MOQ, position, `active | retired` — reaching the tier ladder, gallery, cart, reservation, prepare
snapshot and order line, with `VARIANT_REQUIRED` enforced under the pricing row locks and again by
trigger.

**What is not expressible:** a matrix. There is no `optionName`/`optionValue` pair, so "Sea blue ×
Large" is one opaque variant name rather than two axes a buyer can pick independently. Both
reference markets are axis-based — Amazon's variation themes, Alibaba's multi-spec SKU grid, which
is the centre of its product page.

**Recorded as deferred rather than missing.** The flat list is the right shape until a category
actually sells on two dimensions, and A1's cart rule holds either way. Building axes early means a
migration of every row that reaches an order line snapshot, for a UI nothing has asked for.

**What it would take when asked:** `commerce_product_variant_option{variantId, optionName,
optionValue, position}` with a unique `(variantId, optionName)`, an optional swatch image per
option value, and a projection that groups axes for the picker while the variant stays the buyable
unit. The order-line snapshot keeps recording the variant name, because that is what was bought.

**Rule, unchanged from A1:** a variant reaching an order line is snapshotted like every other
commercial fact. Axes are a browse construct; the variant is the commercial one.

---

### A27. Two one-column absences — **SHIPPED (`0094`, `0097`)**

Neither was worth an entry of its own and both were load-bearing for a surface above.

- **Lead time was flat, not banded.** `product.leadTimeMinDays`/`leadTimeMaxDays` are per product,
  but `sections/packaging-and-delivery.tsx` renders three lead-time bands keyed to the same quantity
  bounds as the price tiers. `product_pricing_tier.leadTimeDays` is the home, and it is resolved
  inside `resolveUnitPriceInCents` so A13's promise chain reads it at preparation exactly where it
  already reads `lead_time_max_days_snapshot`. **The SELECTED tier's value, never an aggregate** —
  the `min()` both MOQ readers use ignores `variant_id` and conflates the product ladder with
  variant ladders, and a `min(leadTimeDays)` would report a band the buyer's quantity never touched.
  Nothing was backfilled: NULL means "the product's applies", which is what every existing row
  means, and copying the product value down would fake a declaration the seller never made.
- **A thread had no attachment upload.** Closed by A30's `POST /commerce/documents`, which is the
  single authorized-document creation route both surfaces needed. There is still **no first-party
  video ingest anywhere in this codebase**, so a message video follows A8's shape — an external id
  under a supply CHECK — or it does not ship.

**Still absent, and recorded rather than silently missing:** any author edit/delete of a review —
`deleteAllReviewMedia` having no caller is the trace of that absence. (Per-viewer vote state on the
public review read, also recorded here, shipped with A24.)

### A28. A participant could not read a dispute they raised — **SHIPPED (`0096`)**

`commerce-trust.routes.ts` exposed exactly three dispute routes — a buyer raises one, an admin lists
them, an admin decides — and **no participant-scoped read**. A buyer filed a dispute over a $200,000
order and had no route that answered "what is happening with it". The reference existed, the row
existed, `commerce_dispute_buyer_idx` and `_counterparty_idx` existed with no reader, and the only
parties who could see any of it were platform staff.

**What exists now:** `GET /commerce/disputes/:disputeId` and a cursor-paginated
`GET /commerce/disputes`, authorized against the disputed order's `buyerOrganizationId` **or**
`counterpartyOrganizationId` — `cancelOrder`'s predicate verbatim — answering `404` (not `403`) to
anyone else so the route cannot probe which dispute ids exist. The detail carries the
`commerce_dispute_event` timeline and `decisionNote`; the deciding moderator's identity is not
projected, because which member of staff decided is not a fact either trading party has a claim on.

**Deliberately NOT `evaluateDisputeOpeningRelationship`**, which splits party-but-not-buyer into a 403. Only a buyer may OPEN a dispute; both parties may READ one, and the counterparty being told a
dispute exists against them is the entire point of telling them.

**What it is still not wired to.** `dispute.service.ts` has a `DisputeView` with a tempting shape
and it belongs to the **R&D proof-of-effort** dispute domain — the `dispute` / `dispute_vote`
tables, scoped to a research project, about contribution claims. Wiring the commerce page to it
would show one organization another's equity dispute.

Migration `0096` adds `(buyer_organization_id, created_at DESC, id)` and its counterparty twin; the
shipped party indexes stop at `(org, state, id)` and cannot serve §7's ordering.

### A29. There was no cross-order shipment list — **SHIPPED (`0096`)**

Every shipment route was scoped to an id the caller already held, so a freight forwarder carrying
forty shipments across thirty-one orders had no route that listed them.

**Why the frontend must not work around it.** The available workaround was to list the provider's
orders and fetch each one's shipments: one request per order, fanned out from a browser,
re-implementing a server join in untrusted code. It also cannot be correct — the client holds one
page of orders, so a shipment on order-page two would be missing from a view claiming to list all
of them.

**What exists now:** `GET /commerce/provider/shipments`, scoped to the active organization as the
order counterparty, cursor-paged on `(createdAt DESC, id)`, filterable by shipment state and by an
`estimatedArrivalAt` window. Split as `listShipmentsBy(organizationFilter)` the way `listOrdersBy`
is, so a buyer-facing twin is one line whenever it is asked for.

**Two things the shape of the data forced.** `commerce_shipment` has **no organization column**, so
the scope is an inner join to `commerce_order` — that join is the whole point of the route. And it
has **no `estimatedArrivalAt`** either; the ETA lives on `commerce_shipment_leg`. So the window
filter is an `EXISTS` rather than a join — a join would duplicate a shipment with three legs in
range and make the page size a lie — and the projected value is `max()` across legs, because a
shipment arrives when its last leg does. `null` when no leg carries one, never a fabricated date:
A16's rule that an uncovered lane returns nothing rather than a zero applies to a date as much as to
a price.

The queue row is lighter than `ShipmentProjection` — no product lines, no event history — so a
forty-row page does not fan out into eighty child queries. `GET /commerce/shipments/:shipmentId`
remains the detail.

### A30. A buyer could not attach a file to anything — **SHIPPED (`0097`)**

`CreateDraftRfqSchema` accepted `documentIds` and `assertOwnedDocuments` required every id to name a
`commerce_encrypted_document` the buyer's organization already owned. **No route created one.** The
uploads in this backend were verification evidence, customization assets and A21's image multiparts,
none of which a buyer composing an RFQ can use — so `documentIds` was a field that existed and could
not be filled, and `/store/rfqs/new` shipped with no attachment step at all. On a sourcing request
that is a real loss: the drawing _is_ the requirement.

**Both halves shipped together, because either alone is useless.** The RFQ read projects
`encryptedDocumentId` and mints no URL, so an upload without a download would have left the composer
able to attach a file that nobody — including the buyer — could open.

**What exists now:** `POST /commerce/documents`, reusing the evidence multipart middleware and the
14b scanner path, landing `pending_scan` and answering **202** because both attachment paths refuse
anything that is not `available`; and `GET /commerce/documents/:documentId`, a decrypt-and-stream.
One `trade_attachment` document kind rather than an rfq/message pair, because which resource it
hangs off is a fact the LINK tables record and the same drawing legitimately rides both.

**Access is ownership, a thread the document was messaged into, or an RFQ the reader was INVITED
to** — an open RFQ is broadcast, its drawings are not. Every refusal is `404`, including
`pending_scan` and `quarantined`, so the route cannot enumerate document ids. Cross-organization
reads write a `document_downloaded` audit entry inside the read transaction, throwing if the append
fails; an owner reading its own file is not audited, which is exactly the line
`revealOrderDeliveryAddress` draws.

**Not a presigned URL.** `presignPrivateCommerceDocumentDownload` still has no caller: a signed URL
is a bearer capability that outlives the authorization decision, and thread participation and RFQ
invitation are exactly the revocable sort.

**Found on the way in:** `assertOwnedDocuments` checked ownership but **not**
`state = 'available'`, unlike the message path. Harmless only while nothing could create a buyer
document; the moment this route exists, an RFQ could carry an unscanned or already-quarantined file
and broadcast it to every invited provider. Both paths now check both.

---

### A31. The browse taxonomy had no author — **SHIPPED (Phase 16, `0098`)**

**Needed by:** `src/components/admin/store-categories/store-category-admin-page.tsx`, the staff
console, and `src/components/home/store/categories-index-page.tsx`, whose tree it edits.

**What was wrong.** `commerce_category` shipped in Phase 0 with public reads, a unique sibling-order
index, a cycle check and a seed script — and **no write surface at all**. The hierarchy every buyer
browses was editable only by hand in psql. A seller whose product fitted no existing category had
nowhere to say so, so the honest options were listing under something wrong or not listing.

**What exists now:** ten routes on `commerce-categories.routes.ts` (§6.5) and
`commerce_category_request` (§4.3a) — create with an image, rename, re-parent, reorder a whole
sibling set at once, retire reversibly, plus the seller request queue and its verdict. Eleven new
`platform_audit_event_kind` members record every one of them.

**Frontend today: WIRED, and this entry exists partly to say so.** All ten calls in
`src/lib/store/admin-categories.api.ts` use `getJson`/`sendJson`/`sendForm` against the real
backend — no `resolveMockRead` anywhere in the file. It is one of only two store api modules in that
state, the other being `catalog.api.ts`. **An appendix entry describing something already built is
the failure this register was written to avoid**, so read this one as a record, not as work.

**Rule:** the retire guard's two inputs — `childCount` and `productCount` — are **derived** and appear
in no request body. A client able to set them could talk the guard into hiding a category that still
has listings under it, and a category disappearing from browse while its products remain purchasable
by direct link is the exact inconsistency `ON DELETE RESTRICT` exists to prevent.

**Rule, second:** the moderator chooses the slug, never the requester, and the PATCH body has no
`slug` at all. A slug is a public URL identity from the moment the category is published.

---

### A32. There was no manufacturer directory — **SHIPPED (Phase 17, `0099`–`0101`)**

**Needed by:** `factory-directory-page.tsx`, `factory-detail-page.tsx` and
`composers/factory-inquiry-composer.tsx`, plus the store home's "Factories worldwide" tile that links
into all three.

**What exists:** far more than the frontend's own header assumes. A25 shipped the organization search
document, so a supplier directory is browsable and filterable already. Phase 12 shipped
`commerce_seller_profile` (`factoryCount`, `productionLineCount`, `factoryAreaSquareMetres`,
`totalStaffCount`, `businessType`, `visitPolicy`, `acceptingCustomOrders`),
`commerce_organization_capability` (`oem`, `odm`, …), `commerce_organization_certification` with a
full validity window, and `commerce_organization_media` whose kinds are already `factory` and
`production_line`. The card's `fulfillmentMetrics` is the same object the provider directory already
computes.

**What was built:** §16 in full, as a **projection** rather than a `commerce_factory_*` table set.
The new rows are five and small: named production lines, per-site descriptions, the site-audit pair,
the manufacturing inquiry, and nine columns on `commerce_seller_profile` for sample policy, order
bounds and the inbox switch. **`exportMarkets` was decided DERIVED** — distinct delivery-address
country codes over completed orders where the factory is the counterparty — so it needs no column
and no seller can edit it. Everything else is a read.

**Frontend today:** `factories.api.ts` still resolves fixtures through the real schemas. Its header
cites A25 for the claim that no backend exists; that claim is now stale in both directions — A25
shipped the substrate, and Phase 17 shipped the surface. The remaining work there is dropping the
mock transport, and optionally adopting `otherCertifications[]` on the detail read, which `.strip()`
discards until it does.

**Rule:** a verification state is about the **organization**, never about a capability. `site_audited`
means somebody stood in the building; it does not mean this factory is approved to do injection
moulding, and there is no per-capability approval on the wire at all.

**Rule, and this one blocked the build until it was answered:** `site_audited` and `lastAuditedAt`
had **no record behind them anywhere in this schema**. `commerce_organization_verification` covers
registration, tax, identity, address and bank account — paperwork, all of it. The resolution was to
**add `commerce_organization_site_audit`** rather than drop the third state: staff-written, carrying
a NOT NULL `audit_entry_id` so every row names an accountable human, and withdrawable with a
required reason. `deriveVerificationState` in `store-factories.service.ts` reads it FIRST and falls
through to `documents_reviewed` only when there is no audit — **it never derives one from the
other**, which is the precise collapse the three-state enum exists to prevent.

---

### A33. There was no business forum — **SHIPPED (Phase 18, `0102`–`0103`)**

**Needed by:** `forum-index-page.tsx`, `forum-thread-page.tsx`, `composers/forum-thread-composer.tsx`.

**What exists:** nothing under this name — `grep -ril 'forum' src/routes/` in the backend returns no
file. The nearest built thing is `research_program_post` and its reaction, report and moderation
siblings, which is a threaded board with a moderation queue and is the right shape to copy.
Commerce's own text surfaces are all standing-gated: `commerce_thread` is resource-scoped and 1:1,
Q&A requires a seller relationship or a verified purchase, reviews require a completed order.

**What was built:** §17 — five tables, two public reads, and **twelve writes rather than the one the
frontend contract has**. The extra three beyond §17.3's table are the reply-moderation route, the
community report create and its dismissal, without which the queue §17.4 asks for has nothing to
work on.

**Frontend today:** `forum.api.ts` still resolves fixtures and its composer still writes to
`/commerce/forum/threads`. **The write path moved to `/community/forum/threads`** (§1.1), so the
remaining work there is two path strings and dropping the mock transport — which
`forum.schemas.ts`'s own header anticipates as "the only edit is in `forum.api.ts`".

This entry's real finding stands as the reason the phase was scoped the way it was:
`ForumThreadDetail` renders replies, `helpfulCount` and `acceptedReplyId`, and the frontend contract
had thread-create and nothing else. Shipping the specified surface as specified would have produced
a forum where nobody can answer anything.

**Rule:** `pending_review` on create is the design, not a placeholder. A10 closed public product
comments because a comment would be the only public text surface with no standing requirement behind
it; a forum inherits that problem exactly, and moderation is what lets it exist without reopening the
decision. No copy may say "posted", "live" or "published" on the create response.

**Rule, second:** `helpfulCount` is a count and never a score. No downvote reaches the wire — a
negative signal against a named organization is a reputational act, and this surface has no appeal
process to put behind one.

---

### A34. There was no cofounder directory — **SHIPPED (Phase 19, `0104`–`0105`), capital figures still blocked on §14**

**Needed by:** `cofounder-directory-page.tsx`, `cofounder-profile-page.tsx`,
`composers/cofounder-profile-composer.tsx`.

**What exists:** nothing — `grep -ril 'cofounder' src/` in the backend returns no file at all. The
near-miss is `talent_profile`, user-scoped with availability, visibility, skills and a compensation
ask, which is close enough to be dangerous: extending it would put cofounder rows in the R&D talent
directory, which is a different claim about a different person's intent.

**What was built:** §18 — five tables and the **lifecycle the contract omitted**. As specified,
`POST` answered `draft`, public reads returned only `published`, and there was no submit route, no
`/mine` read and no withdraw: a user created a profile nobody could ever see, including themselves.
All seven missing routes ship (§6.7), plus the two-route moderation queue behind them.

**Frontend today:** `cofounders.api.ts` still resolves fixtures and writes to
`/commerce/cofounder-profiles`; the write path is now `/community/cofounder-profiles` (§1.1). Its
header carries three rules the frontend cannot enforce, which is why §18.1 restates them as backend
rules and adds a fourth — all four are now enforced in `community-cofounder.service.ts`. **The
composer additionally needs its capital and equity fields removed**, because the create schema is
`.strict()` and answers 422 for them.

**Rule:** a declared figure is never rendered as a verified one. `capitalRange` is what somebody typed
about themselves and nobody checked, so no field, label or aggregate may imply "committed", "funded",
"raised", "escrowed" or "available".

**Rule, second:** an equity expectation is an **ask**, never a holding. Nothing here mints, holds,
transfers or records a stake, and the figure is integer basis points for the same reason money is
integer cents — `0.075` and `7.5` are one careless division apart.

**Still blocked, and built around rather than waited on:** §14 carries the open decision. Publishing
what a person will invest, beside a contact affordance, is close to facilitating a securities
solicitation, and how close is a per-market legal answer. So Phase 19 shipped everything else and
**stores no capital figure it would then have to publish**: there is no `capital_range_*`, no
`currency` and no `equity_expectation_basis_points` column on `community_cofounder_profile`, both
wire fields serve `null`, and the create schema answers **422** for either rather than accepting and
discarding it — silently dropping a number somebody typed about themselves would let them believe it
had been recorded. `scripts/verify-store-phase-19-constraints.ts` asserts the absence as its FIRST
check, so adding one of those columns before the decision lands fails a verifier by name.

---

### A35. Routes this backend serves that §5 and §6 never listed — **DOC GAP, not a build request**

**Needed by:** nobody — that is the point. This entry exists because a specification that undercounts
what exists sends somebody to build a route twice, and because two of the drifts below will be a bug
on the day their surface is wired.

**What was wrong.** §5 and §6 were written phase by phase and several routes shipped without a row.
Verified against `src/routes/*.ts` and the mounts at `src/app.ts:171-341`:

- `GET /commerce/rfqs/:rfqId/quotes` — the quote comparison the buyer's compare page reads. Absent
  from §6.2 entirely, which lists every other quote route.
- `GET /commerce/orders/:orderId/fulfillment` — derived fulfillment progress; §6.4 lists the writes
  that feed it and not the read.
- `GET /commerce/shipments/:shipmentId`, `GET /commerce/shipment-legs/:legId/events`,
  `POST /commerce/shipment-legs/:legId/commands`, `GET /commerce/service-engagements/:engagementId`,
  `GET /commerce/service-engagements/:engagementId/events`,
  `POST /commerce/service-engagements/:engagementId/commands`.
- `POST /commerce/providers/offerings`, `GET /commerce/providers/offerings/mine`,
  `POST /commerce/providers/profile`, `POST /commerce/providers/kinds` — **id-free aliases**.
  `mountProviderWriteRoutes` registers each write at both `/providers` and `/providers/:organizationId`,
  aliases first so `/providers/profile` is not captured as `:organizationId = "profile"`. §6.1 lists
  only the id-bearing form; the frontend calls the alias.
- `POST /commerce/organizations/:organizationId/activate`,
  `POST /commerce/organizations/:organizationId/logo`, the addresses CRUD, the verifications pair, and
  `POST /commerce/organizations/:organizationId/documents/:documentId/scanner-verdict`.
- `GET /commerce/settlement/escrow-providers`, `GET|POST /commerce/threads/:threadId/settlement-agreements`,
  `POST /commerce/settlement-agreements/:agreementId/responses` — Phase 14 shipped these and §6 never
  grew a settlement subsection.
- `GET /commerce/admin/moderation-actions`, `PUT /commerce/service-offerings/:offeringId/coverage`,
  `POST /commerce/admin/products/:productId/moderate`,
  `POST /commerce/admin/suppliers/:supplierId/link-organization`,
  `GET /commerce/products/:productId/ranking-status`,
  `POST /commerce/admin/products/:productId/ranking-enforcement`.
- `PUT|DELETE /commerce/reviews/:reviewId/helpful`, `PUT|DELETE /commerce/reviews/:reviewId/reply`,
  `POST /commerce/reviews/:reviewId/media`, `POST /commerce/reviews/:reviewId/videos`,
  `DELETE /commerce/reviews/:reviewId/media/:mediaId`.
- `POST /commerce/products/:productId/questions`, `POST /commerce/questions/:questionId/answers`,
  and the two author deletes.
- `GET /store/products/:productSlug/questions/:questionId/answers`, and the four engagement writes
  `PUT|DELETE /store/products/:productSlug/like`, `.../bookmark`, `POST .../share`,
  `POST .../view-beacon` — which mount at `/store` while owning no store table (§1.1).

**Two contract drifts, and each is a wiring-day bug rather than a documentation nicety:**

- **`GET /commerce/organizations/mine` returns `{ organization, membership }[]`**, and the frontend
  parses `string[]` (`src/lib/store/orders.api.ts:56`, whose own comment admits the mismatch). The
  parse fails closed as a `PARSE` result rather than crashing, which means the failure presents as an
  empty organization list rather than as an error — the worst of both.
- **`GET /store/providers` accepts only `providerKind`, `limit` and `cursor`**
  (`src/modules/store/storefront/store.routes.ts:63`), while `src/lib/store/providers.schemas.ts` documents seven filters
  the frontend expects. A `.strict()` query schema answers **422** for an unrecognized key, not an
  ignored value, so sending one of the seven does not degrade — it fails the whole read.

**Rule:** a route that ships without a row in §5 or §6 is invisible to the next reader of this
document, and the next reader is usually the person deciding whether to build it. When a phase adds a
route, it adds the row in the same change.

### A36. There were no lane rates, and no arrival window — **SHIPPED (Phase 20, `0106`–`0109`), tables empty**

**Needed by:** `sheets/delivery-sheet.tsx` — the per-leg mode picker with a price and a duration
behind each option, and a running estimate.

**What was wrong:** A16's coverage-derived estimate knows a provider _serves_ a lane. It cannot say
what that lane _costs_ by sea versus by air, because coverage carries neither number per mode. So
the sheet summed local floats, which is the client establishing a price, which §0 forbids. The
missing input was never an endpoint — it was **data nobody had bought**.

**What exists now:** `commerce_freight_rate_card` and `commerce_freight_rate_break` (transit days on
the **band**, per §19.2), `commerce_customs_dwell_estimate`, six `moderate_commerce` admin routes to
fill them, a rating service, `GET /commerce/orders/:orderId/arrival-window`, a `lanePlan` beside the
PDP's unchanged `estimates`, and per-seller `arrivalWindows` on `checkout/prepare`.

**Rule, honoured:** partial data yields a partial answer. A missing component is **named**, never
defaulted, averaged, or extrapolated; an uncovered lane returns an empty `options[]`, never a zero;
an uncovered **leg** makes the whole journey unpriceable rather than cheaper; and `shippingInCents`
stays literal `0` — rating from a card is not a booking and confers no capacity.

**And a named absence now names a way forward.** An unrateable lane returns `quotableProviders`, so
the buyer can open an RFQ with the forwarders who sell it. Every price it does return lives inside
`providerQuote` — Qatoto is a marketplace and never a principal (§0), so the rate is the
forwarder's and the wire shape makes rendering it as the platform's impossible (§19.9b).

**Still open — two things, and only one of them is technical.**

_Commercial:_ the tables ship **empty**. No forwarder lane list has been purchased and no broker
dwell figure recorded, so every lane is currently uncovered. There is no seed, deliberately. Until
rows are loaded, the sheet's honest render is "ships in 15–25 days · shipping and clearance not yet
estimated" — exactly what §19.4 designed the `null` window to make expressible.

_Technical:_ **closed.** Chargeable weight shipped in `0109` — every option now prices on
`max(actual, volumetric)` under the forwarder's own divisor and reports which basis won. Everything
remaining in §19.9's divergence list is a deliberate choice, not a defect.

---

### A37. The buyer surface was unreachable without a staff decision — **SHIPPED (Phase 21, `0110`–`0111`)**

**Needed by:** every signed-in buyer screen. Not one component — the whole surface.

**What was wrong.** §14 marked buyer-organization auto-provisioning **DECIDED** and it was never
built. The only application-code `INSERT` into `commerce_organization` was the explicit
`POST /commerce/organizations` (`commerce-organizations.service.ts:294`), it wrote
`tradeState: 'pending'`, and the only `pending → active` writer was `transitionTradeState`, gated
on `moderate_commerce`. Meanwhile cart, checkout, RFQ, quotes, inquiry and messaging all required
`active`. **A signed-in buyer's first cart tap answered `403` and stayed `403` until staff activated
an organization by hand.** Phase 15's rollout had already recorded the same fact from the other
side — "the smoke script's first run 403'd everywhere because it never activated an organization" —
and it was read as a fixture problem rather than a product one.

**What exists now.** `requireProvisionedBuyerCommerceWorkspace` resolves the caller's workspace and
mints a `pending` shell only when they have none. It is mounted on cart, `checkout/prepare`, RFQ
drafting, product inquiry, messaging and document upload. §14's four gates are untouched, and so are
the two in-transaction checks that actually enforce them.

**Where the branch order is the design.** A session pointer is re-proven, never trusted. A pointer
that no longer resolves is an **access loss, not a provisioning trigger** — minting a fresh shell
there would hand a demoted member an empty cart and hide the demotion. Only a caller with no pointer
and no buyer-capable membership anywhere gets a new shell, so a seller who taps the cart lands in
the organization they already own.

**The smoke script found the one thing review would not have.** `prepareCheckout` and
`confirmCheckout` shared a single `assertOrganizationActive`, so opening the router on
`checkout/prepare` still answered `403` from inside the transaction. Nothing else would have
caught it: prepare's 403 and confirm's 403 are the same string, and a reviewer reading the router
diff sees the guard correctly swapped. `assertOrganizationCanPrepareCheckout` is now the prepare
half — a prepare reserves stock and returns totals, neither of which is a promise to anybody
outside the platform, and both are superseded by the next cart edit. The confirm half is unchanged
and is still the in-transaction authority for §14's money gate.

**Two things §14 did not anticipate, and both needed a column.**

- **The server has no country to declare.** There is no geo middleware, and `user.locationLabel` is
  a free-text self-set place whose own comment forbids this use by name. §0's rule is that a missing
  component is **named, never defaulted**, so `country_code` became nullable and
  `commerce_organization_country_pending_ck` confines the absence to `pending` rows. Activation —
  already a moderator review — is where the country gets established, and `transitionTradeState`
  returns `COUNTRY_REQUIRED_FOR_ACTIVATION` rather than letting the CHECK answer with a constraint
  name. `PATCH /commerce/organizations/:organizationId` gained `countryCode` for the same reason:
  without it the shell was a dead end nothing could ever activate.
- **A minted shell and a real applicant were the same row.** Both are `pending`, so a moderation
  queue could not separate them and would drown in shells. `provisioning_origin`
  (`self_declared | auto_provisioned`) is the separator. Declaring a country flips it to
  `self_declared`, because that write **is** the act of asking to be reviewed.

**The nullability was the interesting part of the diff.** It surfaced 15 public projections that had
been reading `countryCode` as non-null. Every one sits behind a `trade_state = 'active'` filter, so
`tradingOrganizationCountryCode` states that invariant once and throws if a query ever loses its
filter — rather than widening wire contracts to admit an absence the database forbids.
`store_search_document` mirrors both the nullability and, via
`store_search_document_eligible_country_ck`, the guarantee that an eligible row still has one.

**A separate type, deliberately.** `ProvisionedBuyerCommerceWorkspaceContext` and
`req.buyerCommerceWorkspace` are new rather than a widening of `ActiveCommerceOrganizationContext`
and `req.commerceOrganization`. That type's `tradeState: "active"` literal is the compile-time proof
about thirty handlers depend on, `checkout/confirm` among them; relaxing it would have admitted a
pending shell to all of them at once. Two types means reading the wrong one does not compile.

**Not closed by this entry.** `GET /commerce/organizations/mine` returns
`{ organization, membership }[]` while the frontend parses `string[]`, and the parse **fails closed
as an empty list rather than an error** (A35). Auto-provisioning now mints the organization
correctly and that client still renders "no organization". It is a frontend fix and it is the last
thing between this entry and an observably working buyer surface.

---

### A38. A write keyed on an id no list route yielded — **SHIPPED (Phase 21, `0112`–`0113`)**

**Needed by:** the messaging surface, the attachment picker, the refund panel, the provider's bid
list, the seller's Q&A and review queues — and §14's settlement agreements, which were unreachable
for a reason that had nothing to do with settlement.

**What was wrong, and it was ONE defect wearing nine faces.** A22, A28 and A29 each closed an
instance of it in Phase 15 without the shape being named: **a write or detail route keyed on an id
that no list route ever produced.** Every such route works exactly once — in the session that
minted the id — and is unreachable after a reload. The failure presents as an empty screen rather
than an error, which is why it kept surviving review.

| Closed                                     | The id nobody could obtain                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /commerce/threads`                    | `POST /commerce/threads` returned a `threadId` and nothing else yielded one. **This also closed §14's settlement agreements**, whose `GET\|POST /threads/:threadId/settlement-agreements` take the same id — one missing read, two dead features. |
| `paymentIntentId` on the order projections | `POST /orders/:orderId/payment-intents` minted one and `GET /payments/:paymentIntentId` consumed one. Reload the order and the buyer could not pay it.                                                                                            |
| `GET /commerce/refunds`                    | Refunds were POST-only. A buyer could request one and neither party could see that they had.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `GET /commerce/provider/quotes`            | `/rfqs/:rfqId/quotes` is RFQ-scoped and `/provider/rfqs` lists the WORK — an RFQ leaves that queue when it closes, taking any quote on it out of reach.                                                                                           |
| `GET /commerce/documents`                  | A30 shipped upload and download. `documentIds` and `encryptedDocumentIds` could only be filled with an id minted in the same session.                                                                                                             |
| `GET /commerce/shipments`                  | A29 shipped the provider half and left the buyer the workaround A29 had rejected for the provider.                                                                                                                                                |
| `GET /commerce/seller/questions`           | A9 shipped the answer write and only public per-product reads. A seller with two hundred listings could answer a question and could not find one.                                                                                                 |
| `GET /commerce/seller/reviews`             | The reply write took an id only the public reads produced.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `PATCH /commerce/reviews/:reviewId`        | A review was permanent; a mistyped rating stood forever.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**Where a filter carries the feature.** `?unansweredOnly=` and `?unreplied=` are not conveniences —
they are the whole point of their routes. Both resolve against facts the schema already maintains:
`commerce_product_question.hasSellerAnswer` is a column `refreshQuestionAnswerSummary` keeps in
step, and `commerce_review_reply.reviewId` is a PRIMARY KEY, so "unreplied" is a key lookup rather
than a scan.

**Two scoping decisions worth restating, because the obvious version of each is wrong.**
`GET /commerce/refunds` scopes through the ORDER, not the refund row: `commerce_refund` carries
`buyerOrganizationId` and no counterparty, so the obvious filter would have hidden every refund
from the seller whose order it reverses. `GET /commerce/documents` lists OWN UPLOADS only, not
everything `organizationMayReadDocument` admits — enumerating documents shared through a thread
would turn an attachment picker into a cross-organization file browser.

#### A38's second half: what a published rating may become

The audit that produced this entry called a permanent review a defect and asked for edit and
delete. **Both platforms were checked before deciding, and the answer changed the design.**

|                       | Amazon             | Alibaba              | Here                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Buyer edit            | Anytime, unlimited | Once, within 30 days | **Once, within 30 days**        |
| Buyer delete          | Anytime            | Not offered          | **Not offered**                 |
| Seller reply edit     | —                  | Once, within 30 days | **Once, within 30 days**        |
| Helpful votes on edit | Reset              | —                    | **Reset, and the rows deleted** |

Amazon is permissive and funds an anti-manipulation enforcement arm to absorb the consequences.
Alibaba bounds the problem in the data model instead. **This platform has no enforcement arm, so
it takes Alibaba's shape and goes one step further.**

**The strongest control was already built and is left untouched.** `commerce_review` is keyed on
`completionId` with `commerce_review_completion_reviewer_uidx` — one review per completed order per
buyer organization, and no review without a real completion. Incentivized and unverified reviews
are structurally impossible, which neither platform achieves as cleanly. Every vector below is
about mutation AFTER publication.

| Vector                                                                                                               | Closed by                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Extortion** — "pay me or the 1-star stays"; on five-figure orders this is a business model                         | No author delete. Removal goes through A12's content report, so a seller must convince a MODERATOR rather than the buyer |
| **Vote laundering** — a review earns endorsements as praise, is rewritten as a complaint, and keeps the social proof | `helpfulCount` zeroed and `commerce_review_vote` rows deleted on edit                                                    |
| **Aggregate oscillation** — flipping 5↔1 on a seller with few reviews                                                | One edit, ever                                                                                                           |
| **Retaliation timing** — waiting for the repeat order to ship, then rewriting the old review                         | 30 days from `createdAt`                                                                                                 |
| **Reply swap** — a conciliatory public reply removed once the buyer relents                                          | The same window and cap on `PUT\|DELETE /reviews/:reviewId/reply`, which had neither                                     |

**`editedAt` is projected publicly, and that is the point.** A rewrite that does not announce
itself is the manipulation rather than the correction. It doubles as the has-spent-the-one-edit
flag, which is why it is a column and not `updatedAt` — `updatedAt` carries `$onUpdate` and moves
on every helpful vote and every photo attach, so it can answer neither question.

**No aggregate re-roll happens on a rating change, and that is not an omission.**
`commerce-trust-metrics.service.ts` computes `averageRating` with `avg()` at read time and nothing
in the schema denormalizes a rating, so a changed rating is already correct on the next read.

**What is NOT tested, stated rather than implied.** The window is transactional logic, not a
CHECK, and every test suite in this repo mocks `#src/db/index.js` — there is no database-backed
harness to exercise one-edit-in-thirty-days against. The route tests cover the guard chain, the
`.strict()` body and each refusal's status code, including an assertion that no author `DELETE`
route exists. `verify-store-phase-21-constraints` adds four live-data invariants — nothing edited
before creation, nothing edited past day 30, no edited review carrying pre-edit votes — which are
what would catch the rule having drifted.

---

### A39. The counts and the results came from different tables — **SHIPPED (Phase 22, `0114`)**

**Needed by:** every filtered browse surface. A25 shipped the filters and left this open in its own
closing paragraph; `docs/STORE_PHASE_15_ROLLOUT.md` called moving the facets onto the search
document "the natural next edit". It was.

**What was wrong, and it was not the drift risk A25 described.** `getCategoryFacets` aggregated
over `product`; every filter read `store_search_document`. The two had already diverged:

- **Stock.** `mapProductCard` derives stock from the ACTIVE VARIANT SUM (`store-catalog.service.ts`),
  and A25 made the document's `stock_state` variant-aware for exactly that reason. The facet's raw
  SQL read `p.stock_quantity` alone. So a category page could render **"In stock (12)" above twelve
  cards reading _Unavailable_** — same request, same products, two answers.
- **Price.** The facet published `product.price_in_cents`; the document stores
  `min(active variant price) ?? product.priceInCents`. A variant-priced listing was counted at a
  price no buyer could filter to.
- **Eligibility was written three times** — a Drizzle predicate, a six-clause hand copy in raw SQL
  inside the facet query, and the denormalized `is_eligible` boolean — and `deriveStockState` four
  times, counting the facet's CASE ladder.

**And the rule was broken in the other direction too.** `/store/search` carried thirteen filters and
published **no facets at all**, so a buyer could narrow and never learn how many narrowing would
leave. Meanwhile the category page published four counts and `listEligibleProducts` could filter on
**none** of them.

**What exists now.** `computeStoreSearchFacets` reads `store_search_document` and shares
`buildStoreSearchFilters` with `searchStoreDocuments` — one builder, so a count and its result set
cannot disagree without being wrong for both. `getCategoryFacets` is a thin caller taking a SLUG
(the document is scoped by `category_slug`, exactly as the filters are), and its 4087 characters of
duplicated eligibility and stock logic are deleted. `/store/search` answers `facets`; five
dimensions have a count for the first time.

**Drill-down, each facet blind to its own filter.** A facet counts under every OTHER applied filter
and not its own, so a buyer who picked "In stock" still sees `low_stock (12)` beside it and can
switch in one click. Amazon and Alibaba both behave this way. Counting a facet under its own filter
collapses it to the value already chosen and the only way back is to clear it, losing every other
narrowing with it. That is why this is N grouped queries rather than one scan — they differ from
each other by exactly one predicate, and each hits a partial index this table already carried.
**Zero-count values stay absent rather than padded**, which is what the four original facets did:
neither a country code nor a price range has a closed value set, so padding could never be uniform.

**Three defects found while doing it, each its own commit.**

- **A moderator-hidden listing stayed findable in search.** `is_eligible` is frozen at write time
  and `commerce-content-reports.service.ts` enqueued no refresh — the file had no `enqueue` in it.
  Its own comment asserted the opposite ("removes the listing from every public read with no new
  filter anywhere"), true of every read that evaluates `publicProductEligibility` live and false of
  the one place a hidden listing most obviously must not be. Fixed on all three paths — automatic
  threshold hide, moderator decision, restore — each after its transaction commits, because a
  refresh inside it would read the pre-moderation row and undo the hide.
- **A category verdict did not move the listing in search.** `decideCommerceCategoryRequest`
  reassigns products and enqueued nothing, so a moved listing was missing from its new category's
  results while still counted under its old one. **The verifier found this on its first run**, on
  three rows in the development database.
- **A sort changed what matched.** The three sort branches built three different text predicates and
  the discovery branch skipped `escapeLikePattern`, so a query containing `%` or `_` matched a
  different set of documents depending on how the caller asked them to be ordered. One expression
  now, shared with every facet count.

**Two duplications removed.** `listActiveCategorySubtreeSlugs` existed twice, byte for byte, and
search called its private copy — so the facets and the filters could have been given different
subtree rules by editing either. And `store_search_document_category_idx` indexes `category_id`,
which **no query path reads**; `0114` adds the partial `(is_eligible, category_slug, id)` the reads
actually use, and the old index stays only for the FK.

**Rule, now binding both ways:** a filter and its count are one query. If they can be written
separately they will eventually disagree, and the disagreement is invisible in review because each
half is correct on its own.

**How it is checked, since nothing checked either half before.**
`verify-store-phase-22-constraints` asserts the document against live data — stock and price against
the variant sum, no eligible document for a product the catalog would hide, and the reverse. The
rule is restated in SQL rather than imported, because a verifier that calls the implementation only
proves the implementation equals itself. `smoke-store-phase-22` asserts the phase itself over HTTP:
**every facet count equals the number of results returned when that value is applied as a filter**,
across every dimension, plus drill-down blind-to-self and the category page agreeing with the same
query on search.

---

### A40. Four things that were quietly wrong — **SHIPPED (Phase 23, `0115`–`0118`)**

**Needed by:** the review strip, the quote form, the dispute timeline, and whoever loads the first
freight rate card. Four unrelated defects, closed together because each was small enough that none
would ever have been given a phase of its own — and one of them turned out not to be small.

#### A dead review video rendered forever

`attachReviewVideo` stores a well-formed YouTube id without checking that it resolves, and A22's
closing note recorded both the gap and the decided fix: **HIDE, NOT DELETE**. A buyer's testimony
must not be deleted because a third party removed a file, and a video that returns — unlisted
flipped back to public — must be able to come back with it.

`0117` adds `commerce_review_media_state` (`visible | unavailable_upstream`) and `0118` the column,
its `unavailable_at`, and two CHECKs: the state and the timestamp are one fact in both directions,
and only a `youtube_video` row may be unavailable upstream, because a photo's bytes are on
Cloudinary and this platform controls those.

**A NEW TWO-VALUE ENUM, not `commerce_ugc_visibility_state`.** That type's four values are all
about WHO MODERATED, and its own comment forbids exactly this reuse: an automatic hide is not a
human decision, and flattening the two would make the moderation queue lie about who acted. None of
its values says "the host deleted it".

**The nightly job gained a second candidate set rather than a sibling.**
`revalidate-youtube-embeds` already ran at 05:10, already called `verifyYoutubeVideo`, and already
got the hard part right — `YOUTUBE_VERIFY_FAILED` is evidence of nothing, and a run where YouTube
answered nothing at all throws rather than reporting success. One cron, one dead-letter queue, one
per-run oEmbed cache, so a video that appears both as a `video` row and in a review is checked once.

#### What that decision cost, which is the part worth reading

**`media_count` COUNTS VISIBLE MEDIA from Phase 23 on**, because `hasMedia=true` has to keep
meaning "has media you can see". Every read of that counter therefore had to be re-examined, and
the first commit missed three:

- **Positions are NOT repacked on a hide** — a hidden row keeps its slot so an un-hide restores it
  in place, and the gallery renders around the gap. `repackReviewMediaPositions` is deliberately
  not reused; repacking would free a sixth slot and turn the six-item cap into "six visible".
- So `position: review.mediaCount` on both attach paths chose a slot that was **still occupied**,
  and `commerce_review_media_position_uidx` refused it — a 500 on a buyer's own review, and on the
  photo path the just-uploaded Cloudinary asset was destroyed on the way out.
- And the cap itself became "six VISIBLE" against a `position BETWEEN 0 AND 5` CHECK that means six
  attached, so a seventh row could be accepted by the service and then refused by the database.
- `detachReviewMedia` decremented unconditionally, but the job had already decremented when it hid
  the row — so detaching a hidden row decremented twice and pushed the counter below the media the
  review still shows.

`readReviewMediaOccupancy` answers both questions from the rows instead: `count(*)` for the cap,
`max(position) + 1` for the slot, under the review lock the attach paths already hold. Not one
number for both — they disagree the moment a detach is interrupted, and the unique index is on the
position, not on the count.

**None of this was reachable by any existing test.** Every review-media suite mocks
`#src/db/index.js`, so the unique index that actually refuses is present in none of them.
`commerce-trust.media-slots.test.ts` pins it against a hand-stubbed database — five visible rows and
six attached, which is what one dead video looks like — and three of its four assertions fail
against the code as first shipped.

#### `BANANA` was a valid Incoterm

`commerce_quote_revision.incoterm` carried a 20-character length check and
`commerce_order.incoterm_snapshot` carried **nothing at all** — a snapshot less constrained than
the column it is copied from. Nothing in the codebase branched on the value: all sixteen sites were
pass-through assignment or a type declaration.

`0115`/`0116` make both columns `commerce_incoterm`: Incoterms 2020, all eleven —
`EXW FCA CPT CIP DAP DPU DDP` for any mode, `FAS FOB CFR CIF` for sea and inland waterway.

**The `USING` clause is the only way this could have been cleaned.**
`commerce_prevent_submitted_quote_revision_mutation` is a row trigger that refuses any write to a
submitted revision, so an `UPDATE … SET incoterm = NULL` cleanup was impossible. DDL does not fire
row triggers, so the cast did what no statement could: anything that was never a real Incoterm
became NULL, which is the honest outcome for a value that named no term.

**Vocabulary only.** §19.9's Incoterm divergence stays open — a term is now spelled correctly and
still means nothing to the rating.

#### A dispute had no way to say anything after it was opened

`commerce_dispute_event.note_added` had existed since `0052` **with no writer**, while A28's
participant read has rendered the timeline — `note` included, no `eventKind` filter — since Phase 15. So a note had somewhere to appear all along and nothing to put there: a buyer could open a
dispute over a six-figure order and then say nothing further, and the seller could read the
accusation and not answer it.

`POST /commerce/disputes/:disputeId/notes`, guarded exactly as its siblings are. **Both parties,
while the dispute is open** — both can already read it, and a counterparty who cannot respond makes
the timeline a one-sided record of a two-sided disagreement. Refused once the dispute is decided,
because `decideDispute` has by then restored the order's `priorOrderState` and the table is
append-only, so a late note could never be withdrawn. **A non-party gets `404`, never `403`** —
A28's rule, so the route cannot be used to enumerate dispute ids.

The party check MOVED out of `getDisputeForParticipant` into `isDisputeParty` rather than being
copied: a second copy is how the read and the write eventually disagree about who may speak in a
dispute they can both see. Sequence numbering was unified while there — `openDispute` hard-coded 0
and `decideDispute` used `count(*)`, which agree only because every writer starts at zero;
`nextDisputeEventSequence` is `MAX + 1` for all three, taken under the `FOR UPDATE` every caller
already holds.

The response is the whole updated timeline rather than the one note, so the answer and a refresh
cannot disagree.

#### The first freight rate card would have done nothing

No code, and §19.11 is the whole fix. Two rules decided whether a lane rendered anything and were
written where a spec reader finds them and an operator does not: a card created without a future
`validFrom` is in force immediately and its `/breaks` routes can then never succeed, and a card
with no band at `minBillableWeightGrams: 0` reports every small consignment as an uncovered lane —
indistinguishable, to the buyer, from having loaded no data at all.

#### How it is checked

`verify-store-phase-23-constraints` asserts the two new CHECKs — both by probe and by reading
`pg_get_constraintdef`, because a probe needs a review, a review needs a completion, and a
development database that has never taken an order would otherwise report four skips as four
passes. It also asserts the enum's eleven members, both incoterm columns' type, the amended
`media_count` invariant, contiguous media positions across ALL rows including hidden ones, and
contiguous dispute event sequences now that a third writer appends to them.

`verify-store-phase-10-constraints`' media assertion was amended in the same change to count only
visible rows; left alone it would have started failing the first night the job hid a video.

`smoke-store-phase-23` drives the dispute note and the Incoterm vocabulary over HTTP. **Its media
check could not run when this shipped, and said why rather than skipping quietly:** a completion is
minted only when a shipment is marked delivered, an order becomes shippable only when a payment
settles, and `applyPaymentSettlement` posted `buyer_clearing` and `order_held` — two accounts Phase
14's rail map permits only on `internal_custody`, which no live order uses.

**CLOSED in Phase 24; see A41.** The postings are rail-aware now, so the smoke buys, pays, ships and
delivers an order end to end, and the media check runs against a real
`commerce_review_media_position_uidx` — the refusal no mocked-database test in this repo can reach.

---

### A41. No payment could settle on any rail a live order uses — **SHIPPED (Phase 24, no migration)**

**Needed by:** every order. `POST /orders/:orderId/payment-intents` answered `202`, the order moved
to `payment_processing`, and it stayed there forever.

**What was wrong.** `applyPaymentSettlement` posted `buyer_clearing → order_held`. That pair says
QATOTO IS HOLDING THE BUYER'S MONEY, which §14 decided it never does; Phase 14 froze the pair onto
`internal_custody` — the rail it retired — and the same phase made the journal rail-aware, mirroring
`commerce_settlement_rail_account_guard` in a TypeScript map so a forbidden account fails fast and
legibly. **The payment service was never revisited.** A `grep` for "rail" in a 1,500-line file that
decides how money is recorded returned nothing at all.

So every settlement threw inside `appendCommerceJournalEntry`, the outbox `catch` recorded the
message in `last_error`, and the row retried eight times with backoff before dead-lettering. The
refund path was broken the same way (`order_held → refunds_payable → buyer_clearing`), and had
anyone reached it.

**What it cost downstream, which is how it was finally noticed.** An order that cannot leave
`payment_processing` is not shippable (`SHIPPABLE_ORDER_STATES`), so no shipment could be created, so
`issueCompletionsForOrder` never ran, so no completion and no review could exist. Phase 23's A40
smoke could not construct a review to attach media to and skipped its own load-bearing check; that
skip is what led here.

**No migration.** Every account, entry kind and column this needed already existed —
`direct_settled` had been in `commerce_journal_kind` since Phase 14 with **no writer**, its comment
reading "the `direct_processor` rail settling buyer → seller, with the seller as the settlement
account". Phase 14 built the vocabulary; nothing moved the payment path onto it.

#### What each rail posts now

| Rail                                | On settlement                                                                 | On refund                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `direct_processor`                  | `direct_settled`: `settlement_funding_memo −X`, `settlement_released_memo +X` | one entry: `settlement_released_memo −Y`, `settlement_refunded_memo +Y` |
| `internal_custody`                  | unchanged: `buyer_clearing −X`, `order_held +X`                               | unchanged, both entries                                                 |
| `direct_offline`, `external_escrow` | refused before a payment intent exists                                        | —                                                                       |

**NO CUSTODY HOP on `direct_processor`, and the rail map already said so.** The processor settles
buyer straight to the seller's own account, so the money never rests anywhere Qatoto can see;
`settlement_custody_memo` is denied on that rail precisely because a custody balance there would be
value nobody is holding. The memo identity still closes: funding −X, released +X−Y, refunded +Y.

**One entry where the frozen rail needs two.** The legacy refund models money arriving in custody and
then leaving it — two movements because there really were two. On the processor rail there is one.

**The frozen branch stays.** A replayed webhook for a pre-Phase-14 order must post what THAT order's
rail permits; relabelling it would make the journal disagree with the rail it claims, and backing
Phase 14 out has to remain a data edit rather than a deploy.

#### A payment intent belongs to one rail

`commerce_payment_intent.settlement_account_ref` has carried the rule since Phase 14 — "`direct_offline`
and `external_escrow` never create a payment intent at all" — and nothing enforced it. All four rails
reached a settlement that could only post `internal_custody` accounts.

`createPaymentIntent` now refuses the other three with `409` and a message naming that rail's own
settlement path: an offline order settles by wire and is recorded as a party attestation, an escrow
order is funded at the provider where `applyNormalizedEscrowEvent` is the only function permitted to
move the balance, and the frozen rail is history. **The refusal belongs at the request** — the same
refusal eight retries deep in an outbox is a `last_error` column nobody reads.

#### Commission accrues on both rails

`recognizeCommission` was private to `commerce-escrow.service.ts` and reachable only from an escrow
release, so Phase 14's rail table promising "commission + memo funding/release" on `direct_processor`
was a promise rather than a description. It moves to `commerce-journal.service.ts`, which both
callers already import and which owns the rail knowledge — and it is the one posting with no rail
branch at all, because the three `platform_fee_*` accounts are permitted everywhere.

Behaviour is unchanged: a receivable against recognized revenue, never a deduction, since no rail
lets Qatoto take a fee out of money it holds; and **at the default zero basis points it posts nothing
at all**, because a rate of zero means "not decided" and should leave no trace in a ledger. No
reversal on refund — the fee is a receivable and §14 has not decided how it is collected, let alone
unwound.

**Still open, unchanged by this:** collection mechanics (receivable-then-invoice, or a processor
application fee that works only on `direct_processor`), and with them `settlementAccountRef` and
`applicationFeeInCents`, which stay unset because no seller processor account exists to route to.

#### A second defect, found while checking the first

**A failed outbox dispatch could never be retried.** `enqueueOutboxDispatch` derived its
idempotency key from the outbox row alone, and `sendJob` turns that key into pg-boss's JOB ID — so
a re-send deduplicated against every send that row had ever made, a completed one included. The
reconciler re-enqueued the stranded rows every hour, pg-boss dropped each send as a duplicate, and
nothing ran. Its own comment promised the opposite: "the scheduled reconciler will pick up pending
outbox rows."

It surfaced only because the six orders this phase stranded did NOT recover once the postings were
fixed — they sat at `attempt_count = 1` while reconcile after reconcile produced no dispatch job.
The key is scoped to the attempt now: `attemptCount` is incremented under the row lock when a
dispatch claims it, so each attempt gets its own job id, while two enqueues of the SAME attempt — a
create racing a reconcile — still collapse into one, which is what the key is for. All six then
settled and confirmed with no intervention.

**A retry that silently does not happen is the worst shape a retry can have**, and it hid behind
the same silence as the posting: a non-terminal outbox failure is not an error to the job that ran
it, so nothing anywhere said a word.

#### How it is checked, and why it was not

**This service had no tests. None** — not the service, not its controller, not the adapter, not the
outbox. `commerce-journal.service.test.ts` asserts the rail MAP against the trigger arm for arm and
never asks what a producer posts, and `verify-store-phase-14-constraints` reads live journal lines,
which could never be wrong because the wrong write always failed.

The postings are now a PURE PLANNER (`planSettlementPostings`, `planRefundPostings`) and a writer.
The decision that was wrong is the half that needed no database, and
`commerce-payments.settlement.test.ts` holds every planned line against
`COMMERCE_JOURNAL_ACCOUNT_KINDS_BY_RAIL` **imported from the real module rather than restated** — a
test that listed the account names would have been written from the same wrong assumption as the
code. Fifteen assertions; the rail-map one fails against the code as it stood.

End to end, `smoke-store-phase-23` now buys, pays, ships and delivers an order to mint the completion
its media check needs, and reports the outbox's `last_error` verbatim if the payment does not settle.
`smoke-store-phase-14` passes 34/34 — its eight failures were the missing
`SMOKE14_ESCROW_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the server's environment, which that file's own header documents,
and not this defect.
