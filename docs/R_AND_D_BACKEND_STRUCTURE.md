# R_AND_D_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md — Qatoto Research & Development: Pipeline API

> This document describes the **research & development** contract the Next.js frontend depends
> on, and how it is wired on the Express backend (`/Users/vinitchuri/code/backend/qatoto-backend`).
> It is the sibling of [BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md](BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md) (auth & identity),
> [STORE_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md](STORE_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md) (commerce) and
> [STUDIO_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md](STUDIO_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md) (video) — same voice, same layering,
> same envelope — scoped to the whole `/research-and-development` surface.
>
> **Goal:** run Qatoto's concept-to-consumer pipeline server-side — post an idea, form a team for
> equity, log daily work, have that work *verified* into a dynamic equity ledger, raise money into
> escrow, and release it against milestones — with the backend as the only source of truth for
> every number involved.
>
> **Stack (mostly reused):** **Express 5** + **Drizzle ORM** + **PostgreSQL** + **zod** +
> **Cloudinary** (images) + **sharp** + **multer** + **express-rate-limit**, all already installed.
> **Three genuinely new dependencies** (§2): a job runner (**pg-boss**), an object store for large
> files (**S3-compatible**), and a payments/escrow provider (**Stripe**). Better Auth already owns
> identity; this feature owns the `/research-projects/*`, `/discovery/*`, `/funding/*` and
> `/research-programs/*` routes and ~60 new tables.
>
> **Status:** the entire R&D frontend is **pure UI over static mocks** —
> [R_AND_D_STRUCTURE.md](R_AND_D_STRUCTURE.md) §10 and every file under
> `src/mocks/research-and-development/` say so explicitly. Every funding figure, equity share,
> escrow row, opportunity score and verification verdict on the surface today is fabricated. The
> R&D domain does **not** exist in the backend at all (greenfield: `src/db/schema.ts` has the auth
> tables plus three commerce tables and nothing else). This doc is the spec the backend-integration
> phase implements.
>
> **Scope:** all ten routes in [R_AND_D_STRUCTURE.md](R_AND_D_STRUCTURE.md) §3, plus Project
> Immortal (§10) and the full Proof-of-Effort mechanism spec'd in
> [PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md](PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md) (§9). Build order — what ships first and what
> waits — is §16.

## 0. The one rule that governs everything

**The frontend is a hostile, untrusted presentation layer. The backend is the only source of
truth.** (Same NON-NEGOTIABLE principle as [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) §"thin client",
BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md §0 and STORE §0, applied to equity and money.)

Anyone can open DevTools, decompile the Android APK, or point `curl` at the API. So for every
mutation the backend **re-checks everything, every request, by itself**:

- **Identity is server-derived.** Every actor id comes from `req.user.id` (§4a), **never** from a
  request body. A project's `founderUserId`, a pledge's `backerUserId`, a claim's `memberUserId`
  are all stamped from the session.
- **No request body ever carries a value the server owns.** Not a price, not an equity share, not
  a slice count, not an hour count, not a fair-market rate, not an opportunity score, not a
  verification verdict, not a status. The client sends **ids and intent**; the server looks the
  real value up in its own rows. This is the rule that answers *"what if the client edits $1,000
  into ¥10 and posts it back?"* — there is no field to edit. `POST
  /funding-rounds/:roundId/pledges` accepts exactly `{ amountInCents }` and still re-bounds it
  against the round's own min/max; `POST /milestones/:milestoneId/escrow-releases` accepts **no
  amount at all** and snapshots `milestone.escrowReleaseAmountInCents` server-side at request time.
- **Equity is computed, never asserted.** A member's share is the output of the Slicing Pie formula
  (§9) over verified contributions. There is no writable `equityShare` column anywhere in this
  schema and no endpoint that sets one. A founder cannot type a number into someone's stake.
- **Every project-scoped route re-checks membership**, not just a session (§4a). Failure is
  **`404`**, not `403` — a stranger must not be able to probe which project ids exist.
- **Money never touches a float** and never leaves int4 range (§4b). Arithmetic is integer-only and
  runs through one shared module so two servers compute bit-identical results (§4c).
- **Financial and audit history is append-only and never cascades** (§4f). Deleting a user must not
  be able to erase a ledger.
- **Validate the shape of every body/query** with Zod `.safeParse()` → `422`, using `.strict()` to
  reject unknown keys (the prevailing controller style in this backend).

If you remember nothing else from this file, remember §0.

## 1. What the frontend expects

Ten routes, all under `(home)`, all rendering mocks today. The contract each one needs:

| Route | Surface | Needs from the backend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/research-and-development` | Pipeline landing | Project rail, top problem clusters, market insights, open roles |
| `/research-and-development/new` | 4-step idea wizard | Create a `draft` project from `NewIdeaDraft` |
| `/research-and-development/project/[id]` | Detail, 5 tabs | Project + team + milestones + daily logs + funding + escrow ledger |
| `/research-and-development/project/[id]/workshop` | Boards / Files / Chat | Kanban, file store, team chat |
| `/research-and-development/project/[id]/proof-of-effort` | Slicing Pie ledger, 5 tabs | Slice breakdown, verification runs, disputes, optimization, audit trail |
| `/research-and-development/problem-map` | Civic Pulse | Problem clusters with geo + opportunity scores |
| `/research-and-development/knowledge-hub` | Market intel | Insights + demand-signal leaderboard |
| `/research-and-development/talent` | Talent directory | Filterable talent profiles + open roles |
| `/research-and-development/funding` | Investor deal flow | Open rounds + investor-confidence signal |
| `/research-and-development/projects/project-immortal` | Moonshot program | Branch tree, papers, posts, ideas, contributors, stats |

### The wire-format contract

The frontend types today carry **pre-formatted display strings** — `"$6,000"`, `"62%"`,
`"148 hrs"`, `"1.8 MB"`, `"Locks in 9h 14m"`. Every file header under
`src/types/research-and-development/` states this as deliberate: *"every figure arrives as a
pre-computed display string."*

**That changes.** The backend sends **raw integers in explicitly named units**, and each client
formats:

| Kind | Wire field | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Money | `…InCents` | integer cents, always with an ISO 4217 `currency` alongside |
| Equity | `…BasisPoints` | integer basis points, `10000` = 100% |
| Effort | `…Minutes` | integer minutes |
| File size | `…Bytes` | integer bytes |
| Score | `…Points` | integer, stated range |
| Instant | `…At` | ISO-8601 UTC |
| Calendar day | `…Date` | ISO-8601 date-only `YYYY-MM-DD` |

Three reasons this is not negotiable:

1. **Three first-class clients.** Web, native Kotlin/Android, and native Swift/iOS. Native clients
   format money and dates through `NumberFormatter` / `RelativeDateTimeFormatter` /
   `android.icu.text`. A server-rendered `"$6,000"` ships USD and English to every device on earth
   and cannot be localized downstream.
2. **Sorting and filtering.** A string `"$1,450"` cannot be compared, summed, or ranked. The
   server does the heavy queries (§0, CLAUDE.md §"Performance"), but the client still needs
   numbers for progress-bar widths and local ordering.
3. **Durations are stale on arrival.** `"Locks in 9h 14m"` is wrong the moment it is serialized.
   The server sends `locksAt`; the client counts down.

§15 lists every frontend type that must change shape as a result.

> **This is not the security mechanism.** Sending raw numbers does not stop tampering — §0 does.
> The client never sends money back at all, so there is nothing for it to falsify. The wire format
> is a localization and correctness decision; the value-integrity decision is §0.

## 2. The stack

Most of this is already installed for auth, store and studio. Three additions are genuinely new
and each is load-bearing.

| Concern | Pick | Why / reuse |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server framework | **Express 5** | Same app, four more routers. |
| Language | **TypeScript** (strict, ESM `#src/*`) | Shared shapes with the frontend. |
| Database ORM | **Drizzle ORM** | New tables in `src/db/schema.ts`; `pnpm db:generate && db:migrate`. |
| Database | **PostgreSQL** via `pg` | FKs, enums, partial + unique indexes, `bigint` money. |
| Validation | **zod** | Inline `.safeParse()` in the controller → `422` (prevailing style). |
| Image storage | **Cloudinary** (`src/lib/cloudinary.ts`) | Project covers, avatars — reuse the product-image helpers. |
| Image processing | **sharp** (`src/lib/image.ts`) | Reuse `validateAndNormalizeImage`; also the EXIF reader for §9 receipt forensics. |
| Video | **Livepeer** | Reuse the STUDIO direct-upload pattern verbatim — the backend never touches video bytes. |
| Rate limiting | **express-rate-limit** | New named limiters per §4a. |
| **Job runner** | **pg-boss** ⟵ NEW | Postgres-backed queue. Nothing in this repo runs scheduled or async work today, and §9 cannot exist without it. Same database, same transaction, no new infrastructure. |
| **Object storage** | **S3-compatible** ⟵ NEW | Cloudinary is an image CDN. Workshop files are CAD models, spreadsheets and archives up to 100 MB, and some are *forensic evidence* for equity claims (§9) — they need presigned direct upload, versioning and retention that an image CDN does not provide. |
| **Payments / escrow** | **Stripe** (Connect + Treasury) ⟵ NEW | PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md §1 Phase 2 names exactly this. Qatoto must never custody funds itself. |

**Money is integer cents everywhere, in `bigint` columns** (§4b). **Equity is integer basis
points.** No `numeric`, no floats, ever.

```

`req.user` is attached by `requireAuth` (`src/middleware/require-auth.ts`) and typed via the ambient
augmentation in `src/types/express.d.ts` — but see §4a, because `requireAuth` alone is **not** a
sufficient guard for this domain.

---

## 4. Shared foundations — declared ONCE

> **Why this section exists.** This contract was drafted domain-by-domain and the drafts collided
> hard: `project_member` was defined three times with three different role enums;
> `project_governance_role` was defined as *both* a `pgEnum` and a `pgTable` (Postgres puts them in
> one namespace — the migration simply fails); `compensation_kind` appeared three times, kebab-case
> in one draft and snake_case in two; and the Slicing Pie formula was written three ways, all three
> non-deterministic.
>
> Everything cross-cutting is therefore declared here and **only** here. §5–§10 reference these; no
> domain section re-declares a shared enum, a shared table, or a shared rule.

### 4a. Identity & authorization

Today the backend has exactly one guard, `requireAuth`, and no roles of any kind. This domain needs
three layers.

**Layer 1 — `requireAuth` does not prove a human.** `src/lib/auth.ts` registers the `anonymous()`
plugin. An anonymous sign-in creates a real session row, so `auth.api.getSession` resolves,
`requireAuth` attaches `req.user` and calls `next()`. Every endpoint that moves money, mints equity,
or contributes to a distinct-count is therefore wide open to unlimited throwaway identities —
`problem_cluster.distinctReporterCount` (§6), which is the entire sybil-resistance of the Civic
Pulse opportunity score, is the clearest casualty.

```ts
// src/middleware/require-identified-user.ts — NEW
// requireAuth proves "a session exists". This proves "a real, accountable account exists":
// the user must have at least one non-anonymous `account` row (credential, google, github,
// or passkey). Fails with 403, NOT 401 — the caller HAS a session, it is just not enough.
export async function requireIdentifiedUser(req, res, next): Promise<void> { /* … */ }
```

Apply it to every write touching money, equity, effort, a distinct-count, or a uniqueness quota:
pledges, escrow, daily logs, effort logs, problem reports, applications, invites, papers, posts,
reactions.

**Layer 2 — per-project roles, stored as data.** There is no RBAC middleware and this domain should
not invent one, because a middleware cannot return a `Result` and so cannot participate in the
controller's exhaustive error switch (CLAUDE.md §3.2/§3.3). Authorization is a **service helper**:

```ts
// src/services/project-membership.service.ts — NEW. The single authorization entry point
// for every project-scoped route in §5–§9.
export async function requireProjectRole(
    projectId: string,
    userId: string,
    minimumRole: ProjectMemberRole,
): Promise<Result<ProjectMemberContext, ProjectError>>;
// Not a member, or below `minimumRole`, or the project does not exist → the SAME
// { type: "NOT_FOUND" } error → 404. A stranger cannot distinguish the three cases.
```

**Layer 3 — platform roles**, for the handful of staff actions (category moderation, content
moderation, escrow audit). A single nullable `user.platformRole` column, checked in-service.

```ts
// The ONLY per-project role enum. Supersedes the three colliding drafts.
export const projectMemberRoleEnum = pgEnum("project_member_role", [
    "founder", // row owner: edit project, stage, publish/archive, remove members, request escrow
    "admin", // co-signer: approve escrow releases (four-eyes, §7), triage applications
    "maintainer", // create/edit roles, triage applications, manage the workshop board
    "contributor", // post daily logs, read private project surfaces
]);

export const projectMemberStatusEnum = pgEnum("project_member_status", [
    "active", // counts toward the roster and the equity pool
    "left", // self-departed
    "removed", // removed by a founder
]);

// Platform-wide, not project-scoped. NULL for ordinary users.
export const platformRoleEnum = pgEnum("platform_role", ["moderator", "auditor", "admin"]);
```

> **Membership is never hard-deleted.** A departed member's slices, daily logs and ledger postings
> still reference the row, and PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md §2 (the Trust Protocol) requires their
> historical equity stay auditable. `left`/`removed` are states, not deletions.

**The four-eyes rule and how not to break it.** Escrow release requires two distinct people (§7).
That is defeated if a founder can simply grant themselves the second role — so `admin` grants are
**not** self-serviceable: a founder cannot grant `admin` to themselves, and the approver of a
release must not be its requester. Both are checked in `escrow.service.ts`, not in the UI.

**Native clients (Kotlin / Swift) cannot authenticate today.** Four separate blockers in
`src/lib/auth.ts`, all of which must be fixed before any native client ships:

| Blocker | Today | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session transport | `requireAuth` resolves a session from a **cookie** only | Register Better Auth's `bearer()` plugin; native clients send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and store it in Keychain / EncryptedSharedPreferences |
| Passkeys | `passkey({ rpID, origin })` — single-valued, from `FRONTEND_URL` | `origin` must accept an array: the web origin, Android's `android:apk-key-hash:…`, and the iOS associated-domain origin |
| OAuth | `trustedOrigins: [FRONTEND_URL]` — one element | Must include the native deep-link schemes, or every native social sign-in callback is rejected |
| Body size | `express.json({ limit: "10kb" })` global | Several R&D payloads exceed it and would throw Express's raw `PayloadTooLargeError`, bypassing the `ApiResponse` envelope entirely. Raise per-route, not globally |

**New rate limiters** (`src/middleware/rate-limit.ts`), all per-user:

`projectCreateLimiter` · `applicationCreateLimiter` · `inviteCreateLimiter` ·
`problemReportLimiter` · `categoryCreateLimiter` · `pledgeLimiter` ·
`dailyLogSubmitLimiter` · `workshopFileUploadLimiter` · `chatMessageLimiter` ·
`paperUploadLimiter` · `postCreateLimiter` · `reactionLimiter` · `disputeLimiter`

### 4b. Units, money and the `bigint` policy

Restating §1 as a schema rule, plus the two traps:

- **Money is `bigint`, not `integer`.** Drizzle's `integer` is Postgres `int4`, which caps at
  ±2,147,483,647 — **±$21,474,836.47**. A single Series-A round or Project Immortal's
  `estimatedMarketSizeInCents` (`"$12B est. market"` = `1200000000000`, 560× the ceiling) overflows
  it. This must be right on day one, because the escrow hash chain (§4c) covers posting amounts:
  widening the column later invalidates every historical hash.
- **Equity is `integer` basis points.** `10000` = 100%. Basis points give 0.01% resolution, which
  is finer than any cap table needs and keeps the sum exact.
- **An amount is never sent or displayed without its currency.** Every response carrying cents
  carries the ISO 4217 code. Every amount input in a client renders a server-fetched,
  **non-editable** currency adornment. There is no `currency` field in any request body — it is
  derived from the round/project, exactly as `product.currency` is server-owned in STORE §4.

### 4c. Determinism

Two servers, or one server run twice, must produce **bit-identical** integers. Equity and audit
hashes are worthless otherwise — and PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md §2 makes determinism the entire
product argument ("financial determinism vs LLM hallucination"). Four rules:

**1. One arithmetic module.** Every derived integer in this domain goes through `src/lib/money.ts`:

```ts
// src/lib/money.ts — NEW. The ONLY place division, rounding or apportionment happens.
export function divRoundHalfAwayFromZero(numerator: bigint, denominator: bigint): bigint;

/**
 * Apportion `total` across `weights` by the largest-remainder method, so the parts sum to
 * EXACTLY `total` — never 9,999 or 10,001 basis points. Ties break on `tieBreakKeys`
 * (ascending, byte-wise) so the result never depends on row order.
 */
export function apportionLargestRemainder(
    weights: readonly bigint[],
    total: number,
    tieBreakKeys: readonly string[],
): readonly number[];

export function basisPointsOf(part: bigint, whole: bigint): number;
```

`Math.round` / `Math.floor` are **banned** on any apportioned or signed quantity (JS rounds
`-0.5` to `-0`; Postgres `round()` is half-away-from-zero; they disagree). Money and equity
arithmetic in SQL is **banned** — SQL aggregates raw integers, TypeScript does every division.

**2. No float ever touches money, equity, slices, coordinates or ratios.** The specific traps found
in drafting: `unpaidMinutes / 60` (float division — a 20-minute log yields `0.333…`), `exp(-age /
halfLife)` in score decay, haversine distances in cluster centroids, and running-mean centroid
updates. Each is replaced by integer arithmetic, or by a documented integer quantization applied
exactly once at the boundary.

**3. Every job is a pure function of `(data, asOf)`.** Jobs take an explicit quantized reference
instant, store it on every row they write, store **absolute** window bounds (`windowStartsAt` /
`windowEndsAt`) rather than day counts, and re-run to an identical result (§4e).

**4. Every `ORDER BY` that feeds pagination, ranking, or a hash ends in a unique column.** An
unstable sort makes a hash chain non-reproducible and a cursor skip rows.

**Canonical hashing.** `src/lib/canonical-hash.ts` defines the one serialization used by both hash
chains (escrow §7, audit §9):

- SHA-256 over UTF-8.
- Keys emitted in a **fixed declared order**, never `JSON.stringify` insertion order.
- Integers as decimal strings; instants as ISO-8601 UTC with fixed precision; `null` explicit.
- Child collections (e.g. postings) sorted by a documented unique key before serialization.
- A `hashVersion` column on every chained row, so the algorithm can evolve without invalidating
  history.
- Hashes are stored and compared **full-length** (64 lowercase hex chars). The 6-character form the
  mocks show (`"c7d9a1"`) is a *rendering*: at 24 bits, collisions hit 50% around 4,800 entries. It
  must never be used as a key, a cache key, or an equality test.

### 4d. Shared enums

Declared once, in `src/db/schema.ts`, above the domain tables. **All enum values are `snake_case`**,
matching the existing `product_category` precedent (`home_kitchen`). The frontend's shipped unions
use kebab-case (`"full-time"`, `"one-time"`, `"market-research"`) — renaming them is a required
frontend edit, listed in §15. One spelling, everywhere, is worth a one-line union change.

```ts
export const projectStageEnum = pgEnum("project_stage", [
    "market_research",
    "problem_validation",
    "team_building",
    "building_mvp",
    "raising_funding",
    "go_to_market",
]);

export const roleCommitmentEnum = pgEnum("role_commitment", ["full_time", "part_time", "hobby"]);

export const compensationKindEnum = pgEnum("compensation_kind", ["salary", "one_time", "equity"]);

// Replaces CompensationComponent.earnedAsLabel free prose. Shipping English sentences from the
// server forces three native clients to render un-localizable strings, and lets a founder write
// a payout promise the escrow engine will not honour. Clients map enum → localized copy.
export const compensationEarnedAsPolicyEnum = pgEnum("compensation_earned_as_policy", [
    "milestone_escrow_release",
    "on_completion_escrow_release",
    "slicing_pie_vesting",
]);

// The ONE verification status, shared by daily logs (§8), claims (§9) and effort logs (§10).
// Supersedes two colliding drafts with near-disjoint values.
export const effortVerificationStatusEnum = pgEnum("effort_verification_status", [
    "not_run", // no claim submitted yet
    "queued", // enqueued, worker has not started
    "running", // pipeline in flight
    "verified", // all four steps passed → slices awarded
    "flagged_for_review", // a step flagged → allocation withheld pending human review
    "unverified", // no digital receipts → zero slices (SPEC §4 step 2)
]);

export const trendDirectionEnum = pgEnum("trend_direction", ["up", "down", "flat"]);
```

### 4e. The job runner

Nothing in this repo runs scheduled or background work today. §6, §7 and §9 all require it —
verification alone involves transcription, LLM extraction, git API fan-out, AST parsing and image
forensics, none of which can run inside an HTTP request.

**pg-boss**, because it is Postgres-backed: the same database, enlisted in the same transaction, no
new infrastructure to operate.

| Job | Cadence | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cluster-problem-submission` | on submit | Attach a raw submission to a problem cluster (§6) |
| `recompute-opportunity-scores` | nightly | Civic Pulse ranking (§6) |
| `recompute-demand-signals` | nightly | Knowledge-hub leaderboard (§6) |
| `refresh-talent-projections` | hourly | Talent directory denormalization (§6) |
| `reconcile-escrow-ledger` | hourly | Provider ↔ ledger reconciliation (§7) |
| `recompute-investor-confidence` | nightly | Deal-flow signal (§7) |
| `transcribe-daily-log` | on submit | Video → transcript (§8) |
| `verify-effort-claim` | on submit | The 4-step pipeline (§9) |
| `recompute-slicing-pie` | nightly + on verdict | The equity ledger (§9) |
| `sweep-dispute-windows` | every minute | Lock expired 24h windows (§9) |
| `recompute-program-stats` | nightly | Project Immortal stats (§10) |

Every job: an **idempotency key**, bounded retries with exponential backoff, a dead-letter state,
and the `(data, asOf)` purity rule from §4c. A job that cannot be safely re-run is a bug.

### 4f. Append-only and cascade policy

Two of the drafts wired `onDelete: "cascade"` from `user` → `research_project` → `milestone` →
`escrow_release`, which means **deleting one user account silently erases a financial ledger**. One
draft correctly set a ledger's `participantId` to `restrict` and then set `programId` on the same
row to `cascade`, defeating it entirely.

The policy:

- **Financial and audit tables never cascade.** `escrow_journal_entry`, `escrow_posting`,
  `escrow_release`, `provider_transfer`, `funding_round_pledge`, `project_audit_entry`,
  `slice_ledger_entry`, `research_contribution_ledger_entry` use `restrict` on every parent FK.
  A project or user with financial history cannot be hard-deleted — it is archived.
- **Append-only means no `UPDATE` and no `DELETE`.** Enforced with a Postgres trigger plus a
  restricted role, not merely by service-layer discipline. Corrections are **reversing entries**,
  never edits.
- **Content tables cascade normally** (workshop tasks, chat messages, board columns).
- **Taxonomy uses `set null`** — deleting a user must not delete a category every other project
  points at.

## 5. The data — projects, team, roles, applications

### An idea IS a project

There is **no `idea` table**. An idea is a `research_project` with `status = 'draft'`.

The `/new` wizard's `NewIdeaDraft` fields are a strict subset of `research_project`'s columns, so a
separate table would duplicate nine columns and then need a copy-on-promote migration. Worse,
promotion would mint a **new id**, breaking the slug/URL identity and orphaning every watcher and
problem-report backlink accrued while it was an idea. STORE §4 already established exactly this
shape (`product.status` `draft|active`, publish gated server-side); reusing it means zero new
vocabulary.

Note that `stage` (the six-value pipeline position) is **orthogonal** to `status` (the lifecycle). A
`draft` project still has a stage. Do not conflate them by adding an "idea" seventh stage — that
would make `ProjectStage` a leaky union the shipped frontend does not have.

### Enums

```ts
export const researchProjectStatusEnum = pgEnum("research_project_status", [
    "draft", // the wizard's output; visible only to its founder. This IS the "idea".
    "active", // published; publicly readable; appears in the landing rail
    "archived", // withdrawn but preserved — members, slices and escrow history reference it
]);

export const openRoleStatusEnum = pgEnum("open_role_status", ["open", "closed", "filled"]);

export const projectApplicationKindEnum = pgEnum("project_application_kind", [
    "role_interest", // apply-role-sheet, fired from an OpenRole card
    "join_request", // project-header "Request to join", no role attached
]);

export const projectApplicationStatusEnum = pgEnum("project_application_status", [
    "pending",
    "accepted",
    "declined",
    "withdrawn",
    "expired",
]);

export const projectInviteStatusEnum = pgEnum("project_invite_status", [
    "pending",
    "accepted",
    "declined",
    "revoked",
    "expired",
]);

export const researchCategoryStatusEnum = pgEnum("research_category_status", [
    "approved",
    "pending",
    "rejected",
]);
```

`project_stage`, `role_commitment`, `compensation_kind`, `compensation_earned_as_policy`,
`project_member_role` and `project_member_status` are declared in §4d and **not** re-declared here.

### `research_category`

A **table**, not a `pgEnum`, because the wizard's step 1 explicitly lets a user create a category
(`idea-basics-step.tsx` handles the "made a new one" case). A client-writable taxonomy is a spam
surface, so user-minted rows land `pending` and are excluded from public filter facets until
approved (§4a Layer 3 moderation).

```ts
export const researchCategory = pgTable(
    "research_category",
    {
        id: text("id")
            .primaryKey()
            .$defaultFn(() => randomUUID()),
        // Server-generated from `label` (lowercased, hyphenated). The stable ?category= filter
        // key across all three clients.
        slug: text("slug").notNull().unique(),
        // Display label as typed, e.g. "Cold Chain". Clients render this, never the slug.
        label: text("label").notNull(),
        // Server-owned. Seeded rows insert `approved`; user-minted rows `pending`.
        status: researchCategoryStatusEnum("status").default("pending").notNull(),
        // NULL for seeded rows. `set null`, NOT cascade (§4f) — deleting a user must not delete
        // a taxonomy every other project points at.
        createdByUserId: text("created_by_user_id").references(() => user.id, {
            onDelete: "set null",
        }),
        createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
    },
    (table) => [
        uniqueIndex("research_category_slug_unq").on(table.slug),
        index("research_category_status_idx").on(table.status),
    ],
);
```

> Healthcare, Housing, Logistics, Manufacturing, Water) and the categories the six mock projects

### `research_project`

```ts

### `project_stats` — the counter sidecar

A 1:1 sidecar, created in the same transaction as its project row.

**Why a sidecar and not columns on `research_project`:** that table's `updatedAt` uses `$onUpdate`,
so putting `watchersCount` on it would bump `updatedAt` every time a stranger taps the watch button
— poisoning the "recently updated" ordering, every cache key derived from `updatedAt`, and
generating index churn on the hottest row in the domain. Cold entity row + hot stats row is the
correct split, and the 1:1 join is on the primary key, so it is effectively free.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | `text` PK + FK cascade | Exactly one stats row per project |
| `watchersCount` | `integer` | **Counter column**, not computed-on-read. `project_watcher` stays the source of truth; this is a rebuildable cache. Incremented in the *same transaction* as the watcher insert, reconciled nightly against `COUNT(*)` |
| `teamMemberCount` | `integer` default 1 | Active members. Defaults to 1 — the founder row is inserted at create |
| `openRoleCount` | `integer` | Drives the ProjectCard badge |
| `pendingApplicationCount` | `integer` | Founder-facing only; never in the public projection |
| `dailyLogStreakDays` | `integer` | **Job-computed and stored.** A streak is a temporal fold over the whole log history *and it decays with wall-clock time* — it silently drops at midnight with no write happening. Written by the log-ingest transaction and by a nightly decay job |
| `lastDailyLogDate` | `date` | The decay job's input |
| `projectTimeZone` | `text` default `"UTC"` | IANA zone. Without it "a day" is undefined and a distributed team can double-count a streak |
| `verifiedEffortMinutesTotal` | `integer` | Integer **minutes**. Written only by the §9 verification job |
| `allocatedEquityBasisPoints` | `integer` | Written by the nightly slicing-pie job. Per §9.4 this **must always equal `10000`** on a non-degenerate project — the apportionment sums to exactly 10000 by construction, so any other value is an alertable invariant violation, not an "unallocated" remainder |
| `statsComputedAt` | `timestamp` | **Returned to clients** so all three render "as of" and never imply live numbers |

> **Why `watchersCount` is a counter but `dailyLogStreakDays` is a job.** The counter is
> transactionally exact and cheap; the streak is a time-decaying fold that would need
> `(now, timezone, full log scan)` on every card render and still change without a write. Different
> problems, different answers — and only the job-computed fields are covered by `statsComputedAt`.

### `project_member`

Membership as a **granted state** — strictly separate from `project_application` (a *request*).
Carries **no equity and no effort columns**; both are derived (§9).

Key columns beyond the obvious: `projectRole` (§4d, server-owned — accepting an application always
yields `contributor`; `founder` is written exactly once, by the create transaction), `roleTitle`
(free display text like "Refrigeration Engineer" — distinct from `projectRole`, which is a
permission), `skills` (`text[]`), `status` (§4d), `sourceApplicationId` / `sourceInviteId`
(provenance, `set null`), `joinedAt` (server-set from the accept transaction; a client-chosen join
date would back-date slice accrual).

`TeamMember.name` and `avatarImageSrc` are **not** stored — they are joined from `user.name` /
`user.image` on read. A copy drifts the moment someone changes their photo.

`isFounder` is **not a column** — it is computed as `projectRole === "founder"` in the read
projection. Storing both permits the contradictory state `isFounder: true` +
`projectRole: 'contributor'` (CLAUDE.md Pattern 1: make illegal states unrepresentable).

```ts
(table) => [
    // One membership row per person per project, ever; re-joining reactivates the existing row.
    uniqueIndex("project_member_project_user_unq").on(table.projectId, table.userId),
    index("project_member_userId_idx").on(table.userId),
    index("project_member_project_status_idx").on(table.projectId, table.status),
    // PARTIAL unique index: exactly one founder per project, enforced by Postgres, not by hope.
    uniqueIndex("project_member_one_founder_unq")
        .on(table.projectId)
        .where(sql`project_role = 'founder'`),
]
```

### `project_open_role` + `open_role_compensation`

`project_open_role`: `roleTitle`, `skills[]`, `commitment` (§4d), `status`, `slotsTotal` (1–50),
`slotsFilledCount` (server-owned counter, incremented only inside the accept transaction).
`OpenRole.projectName` is **not** stored — joined from `research_project.name` on read.

`open_role_compensation` is a **table, not a `jsonb` column**, because each strand has a
kind-specific numeric range that must be independently queryable ("roles offering ≥ 3% equity",
"roles paying ≥ $4k/mo") and independently validated. It replaces
`CompensationComponent.amountLabel`:

| Frontend label | Columns | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"$4k–6k/mo"` | `salaryMinInCentsPerMonth` / `salaryMaxInCentsPerMonth` | integer cents per month (`400000` / `600000`) |
| `"$9k"` | `oneTimeMinInCents` / `oneTimeMaxInCents` | integer cents (`900000`) |
| `"2–4%"` | `equityBasisPointsMin` / `equityBasisPointsMax` | integer basis points (`200` / `400`) |
| `earnedAsLabel` prose | `earnedAsPolicy` (§4d) + optional `earnedAsNote` | enum; clients render localized copy |

Two server-side validations that matter: the equity range is an **advertised offer**, never the
granted share (grants come only from §9), and `max` is bounded `≤ 10000`.
The `earnedAsPolicy` pairing is checked too — `kind='equity'` must be `slicing_pie_vesting`;
`salary`/`one_time` must be an escrow policy. **A founder cannot advertise a payout mechanism the
escrow engine will not execute.**

```ts
// Enforces the frontend type's documented "at most one strand per kind" invariant in the DB
// instead of in a comment.
uniqueIndex("open_role_compensation_role_kind_unq").on(table.openRoleId, table.kind),
```

### `project_application` and `project_invite`

**One table, two directions.** `project_application` is person → project and backs *both* the
apply-role sheet and the "Request to join" button, discriminated by `kind`, which the server
**derives** from whether `openRoleId` is present — `.strict()` rejects a client-sent `kind`.
`project_invite` is project → person (the talent-page "Invite talent") and is a separate table
because the actor, the authorization check and the accept semantics all differ.

Applications stay separate from `project_member` because they have states membership does not
(`pending`/`declined`/`withdrawn`/`expired`), carry a payload membership never should, and must
survive rejection for anti-spam and audit. Merging them would permit "a member who was declined".

Two validations worth noting:

- `selectedSkills[]` must be a **subset of `project_open_role.skills`** for a `role_interest`. The
  sheet renders its chips from that array, so anything else is a forged payload → `422`.
- `expectedCompensationNote` is permitted in the body precisely because it is the applicant's own
  ask, not a server-owned value — but it is never read by the ledger, never influences a grant, and
  must render as "applicant's stated expectation".

### `project_equity_snapshot`, `project_watcher`, `project_stage_transition`

`project_equity_snapshot` is the read-side projection of the §9 ledger — the **only** source of a
member's `equityBasisPoints`. Written exclusively by the slicing-pie job. `project_watcher` is the
watch join table. `project_stage_transition` is the append-only stage history behind
`PATCH /:slug/stage`.

---

## 6. The data — discovery (problem clusters, insights, signals, talent)

### A submission is not a report

The single most important modelling decision in this domain: `ProblemReport.reportCount: 342` means
**342 different people reported the same problem**. So the mock's `ProblemReport` is not a
submission — it is a **cluster**. Two tables:

- `problem_submission` — one row per person per report. What `report-problem-sheet` creates.
- `problem_cluster` — the deduplicated, scored, publicly rendered entity. What the map shows.

Attaching a submission to a cluster (geo proximity + category + text similarity) is heavy work and
runs as the `cluster-problem-submission` job (§4e), never in the request. A brand-new submission
that matches nothing creates a singleton cluster.

The current sheet fabricates `countryCode: ""`, `mapPosition: {50, 50}`, `reportCount: 1`,
`opportunityScore: 40` client-side. **Every one of those becomes server-derived.**

### Geography: `mapPosition` cannot ship

`ProblemReport.mapPosition: { leftPercent, topPercent }` is a **CSS offset into one specific
`world_map.svg` at one aspect ratio**. It is not geography. It cannot be rendered by MapKit,
MapLibre, or Google Maps, so both native clients are dead on arrival, and it couples the database to
a static asset.

The fix: store real coordinates and let each client project them.

```ts
// Integer MICRODEGREES (degrees × 1e6). Integer, not float, per §4c — cluster centroids are
// recomputed by a job and must be reproducible.
centroidLatitudeMicrodegrees: integer("centroid_latitude_microdegrees").notNull(),
centroidLongitudeMicrodegrees: integer("centroid_longitude_microdegrees").notNull(),
```

`countryCode` is **derived by server-side geocoding**, never client-claimed — CLAUDE.md §0 calls
out client-supplied country as untrustworthy by name, and here it feeds the opportunity score.

Web keeps its SVG by projecting lat/lng → percent client-side. §15 lists `mapPosition`'s removal.

### Scores are server-computed, on a schedule

`opportunityScore` (0–100) and `demandScore` are **ranking signals**, and ranking signals are
attack surfaces. They are never client-supplied, never accepted in a body, and never computed
on read. Inputs: distinct reporter count, geographic spread, category demand, recency decay, and
linked-project scarcity.

Two determinism traps to avoid (§4c): exponential recency decay (`exp(-age/halfLife)`) is float —
quantize to integer buckets once, at the boundary; and haversine distance for centroids is float —
use integer microdegrees with a fixed integer approximation.

Scores are written into `problem_cluster_score_snapshot` with the job's `asOf` instant, so a score
is always renderable with its freshness bound and is reproducible from the same inputs.

> **`distinctReporterCount` is the sybil surface.** It is the entire integrity of the opportunity
> score. It counts `DISTINCT reporterUserId` over `requireIdentifiedUser` submissions only (§4a) —
> with the `anonymous()` plugin live and unguarded, one person can mint unlimited identities and
> manufacture a 342-report "crisis".

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `discovery_category` | Shared taxonomy with §5's `research_category` — **one table, not two** |
| `discovery_region` | Region lookup, so the demand leaderboard can join rather than string-match |
| `discovery_skill` | Canonical skills, replacing free-text `string[]` |
| `problem_submission` | One person's raw report. Never rendered directly |
| `problem_cluster` | The deduplicated public entity — `ProblemReport` in the frontend |
| `problem_cluster_score_snapshot` | Job-written scores with `asOf`; append-only |
| `problem_cluster_merge_proposal` | Moderator queue for suspected duplicate clusters |
| `market_insight` | Knowledge-hub insight cards |
| `demand_signal_snapshot` | Job-written leaderboard rows with `rank` + `demandScorePoints` |
| `talent_profile` | Opt-in directory projection of a `user` |
| `talent_profile_skill` | Join to `discovery_skill` |
| `talent_compensation_ask` | The applicant-side mirror of `open_role_compensation` |

`MarketInsight.statValue` is the sneakiest field on the surface — the mocks carry `"+34%"`,
`"68M people"`, `"3× coverage"` and `"-22%"` in one column. It decomposes into
`statKind` (enum) + `statValueMilli` (`bigint`, value × 1000) + `statUnitKey` (enum), and the client
formats both the magnitude and the locale.

`TalentProfile` is a **projection of `user`, not a parallel identity** — name and avatar join from
`user`; the table holds only the opt-in directory fields (`headlineRole`, `availability`,
`locationLabel`, and the denormalized `cachedEffortMinutesLogged`).

> **A live frontend bug this surfaces.** `talent-filter-grid.tsx` filters skills with
> `skills.some((skill) => skill.includes(chipText))` — a substring match, so a "Water" chip matches
> "Water Polo". Moving to `discovery_skill` slugs fixes it by construction.

### Server-side filtering

Every list in this domain is filtered client-side today over tiny mock arrays. Per CLAUDE.md
§"Performance", heavy work belongs on the server. Each list endpoint therefore takes explicit
query params — `?category=&region=&commitment=&skill=&availability=&sort=&page=&limit=` — with
keyset pagination whose `ORDER BY` ends in a unique column (§4c).

## 7. The data — funding, pledges, milestones, escrow

This is the highest-stakes surface in the product. Read §0 again before implementing it.

### Double-entry, not a signed single row

The mock models the ledger as `EscrowLedgerEntry { direction: "in" | "out", amount }`. **Use
double-entry instead**: a journal header plus **≥ 2 signed postings whose amounts sum to zero.**

Four reasons:

1. `direction: in|out` cannot say *where* money came from or went to — and the Governance tab's
   Allocated / Released / Held question is literally an account-balance question.
2. Money in flight (submitted to Stripe, not yet settled) has no honest single-row representation.
   With a `provider_clearing` account it is simply a balance.
3. Provider-vs-ledger disagreement can be absorbed into a `reconciliation_suspense` account, so the
   books still balance while the discrepancy stays *visible*.
4. The zero-sum invariant is a machine-checkable proof that no money was conjured. A signed-amount
   table cannot offer that.

The client-facing `direction: in|out` survives as a **read projection** (the sign of the posting
against `escrow_held`), so the frontend type does not change shape.

### The accounts

`escrow_account`, one set per project: `escrow_held`, `provider_clearing`, `released_to_project`,
`platform_fee`, `refunds_payable`, `reconciliation_suspense`.

```

`escrow_posting` carries `signedAmountInCents: bigint("signed_amount_in_cents", { mode: "bigint" })`
— **positive into the account, negative out**, and `SUM` over one entry **must equal zero**,
asserted in the service before commit and again by a nightly job.

> own open questions. It is not merely a limit problem: the hash chain covers posting amounts, so

> day one.

### Append-only, enforced four ways

Service-layer discipline is not enforcement. All four:

1. The application DB role has `UPDATE` and `DELETE` **revoked** on `escrow_journal_entry` and
   `escrow_posting` — hand-written SQL in the migration. This is the layer that survives a bug in
   our own code.
2. `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` triggers on both tables that `RAISE EXCEPTION`.
3. No `db.update(...)` / `db.delete(...)` call against those tables exists anywhere in the service.
   The only verb is `insert`.
4. `UNIQUE(projectId, sequenceNumber)` plus the hash chain makes out-of-band tampering detectable
   by any verifier that walks the chain (§11 exposes one).

### The money path

```text
POST /funding-rounds/:roundId/pledges     body: { amountInCents }  ← and nothing else
  → server re-bounds against the round's own min/max; derives platformFeeInCents from a config
    basis-point rate; resolves currency from the round
  → creates provider_transfer with OUR randomUUID idempotency key BEFORE any provider call
  → posts escrow_held → provider_clearing, settlement='pending'
  → the provider call happens in a WORKER, never in the request handler

POST /webhooks/payments/stripe            ← the only unauthenticated route in this domain
  → verify signature BEFORE persisting; persist BEFORE processing; dedupe by unique constraint;
    process in a transaction; return 200 for duplicates
  → flips settlement='settled', posts provider_clearing → released_to_project
  → ONLY NOW do raisedAmountInCents and backersCount move
```

`raisedAmountInCents`, `backersCount` and `escrow_account.cachedBalanceInCents` are written by
**exactly one code path** — the webhook settlement handler, inside the same transaction that
appends the journal entry. No controller and no user-facing service function ever touches them.
That is a grep-able invariant.

`percentageFunded` **is not a column and not a request field.** It is computed on read as
`floor(raised * 10000 / goal)` and returned as `percentageFundedBasisPoints`. It cannot be stored,
so it cannot be forged or drift. Clients must render the server's basis points and use the raw
integers only for bar width; the value may exceed `10000` when overfunded, and the client clamps
the *width*, not the number.

**Never trust the webhook payload's amount over our own `provider_transfer` row.** The payload
identifies *which* transfer settled, not *how much*.

### Milestone release — the four-eyes rule

```text
POST /milestones/:milestoneId/escrow-releases   body: { requestNote? }   ← NO amount field
```

The amount is read from `milestone.escrowReleaseAmountInCents` and **snapshotted** into
`escrow_release.amountInCents` at request time — so a founder cannot edit the milestone between
request and approval to inflate the payout, and cannot assert an amount at all.

Approval independently re-derives **every** gate, server-side:

- requester ≠ approver (`422 SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN`, **even for a founder**)
- approver holds `platform_auditor`, or a project `admin` role they did not grant themselves (§4a)
- `milestone.status = 'done'`
- the Proof-of-Effort verdict is `verified` (§9)
- the 24-hour dispute window is closed with zero open disputes (§9)
- `escrow_held` balance ≥ the snapshotted amount

The evidence is frozen into a `verificationSnapshot` column so a later audit can prove **why**, not
merely **that**.

**The payout destination is never client-supplied.** `payoutDestinationId` resolves from the
project's registered provider account. A `destinationAccountId` in a request body is a wire-fraud
primitive; `.strict()` rejects it.

### Reconciliation

When the provider and the ledger disagree, **the ledger is not silently patched.** The nightly
`reconcile-escrow-ledger` job pulls provider balances, writes a `reconciliation_discrepancy` row,
posts the delta into `reconciliation_suspense` (preserving the zero-sum invariant), and alarms.

The provider is authoritative for **cash**; the ledger is authoritative for **entitlement**; the
suspense account is where the two are allowed to differ, in public.

### Regulatory gating

PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md §1 sequences crowdfunding (Phase 2) well before true equity crowdfunding
(Phase 4, requiring FINRA/SEC registration or a licensed broker-dealer partner).

So `config.ENABLED_FUNDING_ROUND_TYPES` (env, default `["crowdfunding"]`) is checked **at the API**
— before creating a round, before opening one, before accepting a pledge, and in the
`/funding/deals` filter. A disabled round type is invisible and un-pledgeable at the HTTP layer,
which makes hiding the chip in `funding-deal-filter-grid.tsx` cosmetic rather than load-bearing.

### Remaining tables

`funding_round`, `funding_round_pledge`, `milestone`, `milestone_variance`, `escrow_release`,
`provider_transfer`, `provider_webhook_event`, `reconciliation_discrepancy`,
`project_member_compensation_rate`, `investor_confidence_snapshot`, `project_audit_entry`.

Two notes. `investor_confidence_snapshot` replaces the hardcoded
`INVESTOR_CONFIDENCE_PERCENT = 78` in `funding-tab.tsx` — computed nightly from log streak, verified
milestones, and dispute rate, and returned with its `asOf`. And
`project_member_compensation_rate` is the locked fair-market rate that §9's slice math depends on;
it is **effective-dated and requires the member's acceptance**, because a founder who can silently
edit a rate can silently rewrite everyone's equity.

### The rejected-keys list

`.strict()` turns each of these into a `422` instead of a silent overwrite. Enumerated so a reviewer
can grep for them on the pledge body:

```text
backerUserId · userId · projectId · currency · platformFeeInCents · netToEscrowInCents
feeInCents · status · verificationStatus · equityBasisPoints · sliceCount · slices
raisedAmountInCents · percentageFunded · percentageFundedBasisPoints · backersCount
escrowAccountId · journalEntryId · ledgerEntryId · providerTransferId · payoutDestinationId
paymentMethodId · occurredAt · createdAt · id
```

## 8. The data — workshop & daily logs

### The workshop is private; every route needs membership

Every `/workshop/*` route runs `requireProjectRole(projectId, req.user.id, "contributor")` (§4a),
not merely `requireAuth`. Failure → `404`.

### Video: reuse the Studio pipeline, do not invent a second one

A daily log's video is the **input to the entire equity ledger**, so it needs the strongest upload
path available — and one already exists. Reuse STUDIO_BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md §5.1 verbatim: Livepeer
direct upload, where **the backend never touches video bytes**. The client requests a short-lived
upload URL, uploads directly, and Livepeer calls `POST /webhooks/livepeer` on completion.

Then `transcribe-daily-log` (§4e) runs, writing `daily_log_transcript_segment` rows, and hands off
to `verify-effort-claim` (§9).

### Workshop and daily-log tables

| Table | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `workshop_board_column` | `position` integer, contiguous, re-packed on delete |
| `workshop_task` | `rank` — see the ordering note below |
| `workshop_file` | `sizeBytes` **integer bytes**, measured server-side, never client-claimed |
| `workshop_chat_message` | `sentAt` with microsecond precision — it is also the pagination cursor |
| `workshop_chat_read_state` | Per-member read cursor |
| `daily_log` | `logDate` (the day **claimed**) + `submittedAt` (the instant) — two distinct fields, never collapsed |
| `daily_log_transcript_segment` | Job-written |
| `daily_log_ai_summary_chip` | LLM output; carries `generatedByModel` + `promptVersion` provenance |
| `daily_log_extracted_claim` | The bridge into §9 |
| `daily_log_evidence_link` | Machine-readable evidence refs |

### Kanban ordering

Use **lexicographic rank strings**, not integer positions. Two members dragging concurrently with
integer positions produce a re-pack storm and lost moves; a rank string lets a move be a single
row write with no neighbours touched.

The trap: `ORDER BY` on a `text` column follows the database's `LC_COLLATE` (typically ICU
`en_US.UTF-8`), which reorders punctuation and case, while a JS or Kotlin `a < b` compares code
points. They disagree, and the board silently renders in a different order than the server
paginates.

```sql
-- Drizzle cannot express this. Add it by hand in the migration.
ALTER TABLE workshop_task ALTER COLUMN rank TYPE text COLLATE "C";
```

Clients sort by code point and **never** compute a rank themselves — `POST /tasks/:taskId/move`
takes `{ beforeTaskId?, afterTaskId?, columnId }` and the server derives the new rank.

### `isEffortVerified` becomes an enum

The mock's `DailyLog.isEffortVerified: boolean` cannot express the pipeline's real states — queued,
running, flagged-for-review, and unverified-for-lack-of-receipts are all `false` today, which is
exactly the ambiguity CLAUDE.md Pattern 1 exists to prevent. It becomes
`effortVerificationStatus` (§4d, six values), with the boolean derived on read for compatibility.

`aiSummaryChips` and `effortVerificationStatus` are **pipeline output** and appear in no request
body.

### Chat transport

REST + cursor pagination for v1, with `GET /workshop/chat/stream` as **SSE**, not WebSockets. SSE
survives proxies, reconnects natively, needs no new server infrastructure, and both native clients
handle it fine. Real-time chat is not on the critical path — the composer in
`workshop-chat.tsx` is a decorative `div` today (§14).

### Files: object storage, not Cloudinary

Workshop files are CAD models, spreadsheets and archives up to 100 MB — and some are **forensic
evidence** for §9 physical-work claims, so they need versioning and retention Cloudinary does not
provide. Presigned direct upload to S3-compatible storage, with
`POST /workshop/files/:fileId/complete` confirming and the server issuing a **`HEAD`** to measure
the real byte size. The client's claimed size is never trusted.

---

## 9. The data — Proof of Effort

The mechanism spec is [PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md](PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md) §3 (the Slicing Pie math)
and §4 (the fraud-defeating verification pipeline). This section is its implementation contract.

### 9.1 The determinism boundary

The single most important idea in this domain, and the product's entire commercial argument
(SPEC §2 — "financial determinism vs LLM hallucination"):

> **AI produces inputs and judgements. The formula produces numbers. AI output is reviewable and
> overridable by a human. Formula output is never hand-edited by anyone — including staff,
> including the founder, including a DBA.**

That line is drawn **in the data model**, not in prose:

| | AI-produced (reviewable, overridable) | Formula-produced (never hand-edited) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Columns | `effort_claim.extractedMinutes`, `groundedMinutes`, `claimSummary` · `verification_step.status`, `findingSummary`, `scoreBps` · `receipt_forensics_check.result` · `optimization_suggestion.*` | `slice_ledger_entry.sliceNumerator`, `slicesAwarded` · `slice_allocation_proposal.proposedSlices` · `equity_snapshot_share.equityBasisPoints` · `project_audit_entry.entryHash` · `member_fair_market_rate.*` once locked |
| Carries | `modelName`, `modelVersion`, `promptVersion`, `confidenceBps` **and** `overriddenStatus`, `reviewedByUserId`, `overrideReason` | **no override columns at all** — their absence *is* the contract |

Corrections flow one way: change an **input** (override a step status, override `groundedMinutes`)
and let the formula recompute — or append a `reversal` entry. Never an `UPDATE`.

Three enforcements, because a rule only one code path respects is not a rule:

1. Nothing in `verification.service.ts` may write `slice_ledger_entry`. Only
   `slice-ledger.service.ts` may, and it only ever writes `computeSlices` output.
2. No endpoint accepts any formula-produced column in a body. `.strict()` → `422`.
3. DB triggers raise on `UPDATE`/`DELETE` of `slice_ledger_entry` and `project_audit_entry`, and on
   `UPDATE` of `member_fair_market_rate` where `OLD.status = 'locked'`.

### 9.2 The math

SPEC §3 gives the model in dollars and hours. In wire units (integer minutes, integer cents) both
contribution kinds reduce to a **single denominator of 3000**:

- Time: `hours × dollarsPerHour × 2` = `(minutes/60) × (cents/100) × 2` = `minutes × cents / 3000`
- Cash: `dollars × 4` = `(cents/100) × 4` = `cents × 120 / 3000`

```ts
// src/lib/slice-math.ts
export const SLICE_DENOMINATOR = 3000n;
export const BASIS_POINTS_TOTAL = 10000n;

export function timeSliceNumerator(effortMinutes: number, unpaidRateCentsPerHour: number): bigint {
    return BigInt(effortMinutes) * BigInt(unpaidRateCentsPerHour); // over 3000
}

export function cashSliceNumerator(cashSpentCents: number): bigint {
    return BigInt(cashSpentCents) * 120n; // over 3000
}
```

Verified against **every** figure in `solar-cold-storage.ts`: 148 h @ $120 →
`8880 × 12000 / 3000 = 35,520` ✓ · 5 h @ $85 → `850` ✓ · 6 h @ $120 → `1,440` ✓ · 8 h @ $60 →
`960` ✓ · 3 h @ $60 → `360` ✓ · $22,120 → `2,212,000 × 120 / 3000 = 88,480` ✓ · $180 → `720` ✓.

> **`bigint`, everywhere, in both TypeScript and Postgres.** A single entry already reaches
> `8880 × 12000 = 106,560,000`; summed over years a project approaches `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
> `sliceNumerator` and every slice total are `bigint`. `slicesAwarded` and `equityBasisPoints` stay
> `integer` because they are bounded and small.

**The unpaid-portion column the mock is missing.** Slicing Pie credits only *unpaid* contribution.
`member_fair_market_rate` therefore carries **both** `fairMarketRateCentsPerHour` and
`paidCashRateCentsPerHour`, and the ledger prices the difference. Without this, a salaried member
earns full sweat equity *on top of* their salary — **this is the largest correctness gap in the
mock**, and it has no frontend representation at all.

### 9.3 Rounding

**Round-half-even (banker's rounding), applied exactly once, at ledger-entry write, over exact
`BigInt` arithmetic.**

```ts
/** Divide two BigInts, rounding halves to the nearest EVEN quotient. */
export function divideRoundHalfEven(numerator: bigint, denominator: bigint): bigint {
    const quotient = numerator / denominator; // BigInt division truncates toward zero
    const remainder = numerator % denominator;
    if (remainder === 0n) return quotient;
    const twiceRemainder = (remainder < 0n ? -remainder : remainder) * 2n;
    const sign = (numerator < 0n) !== (denominator < 0n) ? -1n : 1n;
    if (twiceRemainder > denominator) return quotient + sign;
    if (twiceRemainder < denominator) return quotient;
    return quotient % 2n === 0n ? quotient : quotient + sign; // exact tie → nearest even
}
```

Four rules that make this binding:

1. **Round once**, when `slicesAwarded` is written. Nothing downstream re-rounds; totals are
   `SUM` of already-final integers.
2. **Retain the exact rational.** `sliceNumerator` is stored alongside, so an auditor can see
   exactly where the half-slice went. Rounding you cannot inspect is indistinguishable from a bug.
3. **Half-even, not half-up.** With denominator 3000 an exact tie is reachable. Half-up biases
   every tie upward — a systematic, direction-consistent drift favouring whoever logs the most
   granular claims. Half-even has zero tie bias in expectation.
4. **Sign is explicit**, because reversals carry negative numerators and `BigInt` `/` truncates
   toward zero rather than flooring.

**Anti-dust rule:** a claim rounding to 0 still writes an entry with `slicesAwarded = 0`. Skipping
it leaves a gap in `sequenceNumber` and breaks the audit story.

### 9.4 Apportionment — slices to basis points

**Largest Remainder (Hare–Niemeyer), with a total, deterministic tie-break.** Recorded in the data
as `equity_snapshot.apportionmentAlgorithm = "largest-remainder-v1"`.

Floor alone is wrong: with N members it loses up to N−1 basis points, so shares sum to ≤ 9999. **A
cap table that does not sum to 100% is not a cap table.** Per-member half-even is also wrong — it
can overshoot to 10001 with no correction step.

```ts
export function apportionBasisPoints(inputs: readonly MemberSliceInput[]): readonly MemberShare[] {
    const total = inputs.reduce((sum, member) => sum + member.slices, 0n);
    if (total === 0n) {
        // isDegenerate: brand-new project, every share 0, sum-to-10000 suspended.
        return inputs.map((member) => ({ memberUserId: member.memberUserId, basisPoints: 0, remainder: 0n }));
    }

    // 1. CANONICAL ORDERING first, so the tie-break never depends on row order from Postgres.
    const ordered = [...inputs].sort((left, right) => (left.memberUserId < right.memberUserId ? -1 : 1));

    // 2. Floor each share, keeping the exact remainder.
    const floored = ordered.map((member) => {
        const scaled = member.slices * BASIS_POINTS_TOTAL;
        return {
            memberUserId: member.memberUserId,
            basisPoints: Number(scaled / total),
            remainder: scaled % total,
        };
    });

    // 3. Distribute the shortfall one basis point at a time, largest remainder first.
    //    Tie-break chain: remainder DESC → slices DESC → memberUserId ASC (byte order).
    //    The third key is total, so ties ALWAYS resolve.
    // 4. Assert the invariant rather than assuming it:
    //    if (sum !== 10000) throw new Error(`Apportionment invariant violated: ${sum}`);
}
```

**Canonical ordering, stated once, applying everywhere in this domain:** ledger and audit entries
by `sequenceNumber ASC` (**never** `createdAt` — two rows share a millisecond and replica clocks
skew); apportionment input by `memberUserId ASC` in **byte order** (`COLLATE "C"` or sorted in
application code, so a Postgres locale change cannot move a basis point); verification steps by
`stepOrder ASC`.

**Reproducibility test to write:** run the recompute 1,000 times with input rows shuffled; assert
byte-identical `equity_snapshot_share` rows every time.

### 9.5 The reserve pool — drop it

The mock header in `research-and-development-proof-of-effort-mocks.ts` flags its reserve slice pool
as *"a mild deviation from orthodox Slicing Pie… so the backend phase can revisit it."*

**Revisited: drop it**, along with the fixed 200,000-slice pool it depends on. Three reasons, in
severity order:

1. **It reintroduces founder fiat — the one thing this product exists to eliminate.** The mock's
   39,000 reserved slices are a number a founder chose, and they dilute every real contributor by
   19.5% on the strength of that choice. SPEC §2's pitch ("replaces founder fiat with objective,
   verifiable math") dies the moment a founder-chosen constant sits in the denominator.
2. **Slicing Pie is already self-correcting, so the reserve solves nothing.** When the Cooling
   Systems Engineer joins, they lock a rate and earn slices at their own pace; everyone
   re-normalizes automatically, because the denominator is a live `SUM`. That is the model's
   central property. A reserve pre-pays for that dilution in advance, badly.
3. **It makes the sum-to-10000 invariant unenforceable** — the strongest correctness assertion in
   §9.4 would have to be deleted, or a phantom "reserve member" invented that needs an owner, a
   rate, and a dispute path it can never use.

**What replaces it, so the UI keeps the affordance:** a *projection*, computed on read, never
persisted as slices.

```text
GET /research-projects/:projectSlug/equity/open-role-projection
→ [{ openRoleId, roleTitle, projectedSlices, projectedDilutionBasisPoints,
     assumedRateCentsPerHour, assumedMonthlyMinutes, basis: "advertised-compensation-band" }]
```

Derived from the compensation band the project already advertises (§5). The client renders it as a
**dotted/muted ghost segment outside the bar**, explicitly labelled "projected, not allocated". It
is honest, it is derived, and it is outside the denominator.

The same reasoning kills the fixed 200,000 pool: `1% = 2,000 slices` only holds when the pool is
exactly 200,000, and the pool is `SUM(slicesAwarded)`, which changes daily by construction. Keep
"1% = 2,000 slices" as an onboarding legend if it helps, but `equity_snapshot.totalSlices` is
**emergent** and the client renders whatever it says.

If a project genuinely needs a legal reserve, that is a post-bake ESOP pool — a cap-table concept
created at bake time from frozen percentages, not a live-ledger concept.

### 9.6 Tables

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `member_fair_market_rate` | Effective-dated, immutable once locked. **The most important table in the domain** — SPEC §2's "valuation rules locked in and transparent to everyone" |
| `slice_ledger_entry` | Append-only. `sequenceNumber` gapless per project; `sliceNumerator` (`bigint`) + `slicesAwarded`; `fairMarketRateId` pins the rate used |
| `effort_claim` | The claim under audit. `extractedMinutes` vs `groundedMinutes` are the two halves of SPEC §4 |
| `claim_verification_run` | One pass. `attemptNumber` 1, then 2+ for re-verification |
| `verification_step` | The four ordered steps, with provenance + override quartets |
| `artifact_evidence` | Deterministic digital receipts with identity — replaces `evidenceLabels: string[]` |
| `integration_consent_grant` | Per **(project, member, provider)** — see §9.10 |
| `physical_work_receipt` | `contentSha256` + `perceptualHash` |
| `receipt_forensics_check` | EXIF / device fingerprint / reverse image search |
| `slice_allocation_proposal` | The 24-hour window — the discriminated union, as CHECK-constrained columns |
| `dispute` + `dispute_vote` | Consensus. **`dispute_vote` has no frontend counterpart at all** |
| `project_audit_entry` + `project_chain_head` | The hash chain and its serialization point |
| `equity_snapshot` + `equity_snapshot_share` | The nightly recalculation; makes bake atomic |
| `pie_bake_event` | Exactly once, ever, per project |
| `optimization_suggestion` (+ `_evidence`) | With LLM provenance and a lifecycle the mock lacks |
| `verification_job` | The queue (§4e) |

**Why effective-dating the rate rather than a column on `project_member`:** a raise must not
retroactively re-price two years of logged effort. Each ledger entry stores `fairMarketRateId`, so
history pins to the rate in force. A single mutable column makes every historical slice count a
function of *today's* rate — precisely the founder-tweaks-the-spreadsheet failure mode SPEC §2
exists to prevent, and the bug stays invisible until someone gets a raise.

**Why `groundedMinutes` is separate from `extractedMinutes`:** `extractedMinutes` is *what the
member said*; `groundedMinutes` is *what the artifacts prove*. The ledger prices
`COALESCE(overriddenMinutes, groundedMinutes)` — never `extractedMinutes`. Collapsing them destroys
the audit story.

The union in `slice_allocation_proposal` is enforced by CHECK constraints, which is what makes it a
real state machine rather than four optional strings:

```ts
check("proposal_locked_shape",
    sql`(status <> 'locked') OR (locked_at IS NOT NULL AND settled_ledger_entry_id IS NOT NULL)`),
check("proposal_disputed_shape",
    sql`(status <> 'disputed') OR (active_dispute_id IS NOT NULL AND escrowed_slices > 0)`),
check("proposal_escrow_zero",
    sql`(status = 'disputed') OR (escrowed_slices = 0)`),
```

Two unique indexes that are easy to omit and expensive to miss:

```ts
// One commit must not fund two members' claims.
uniqueIndex("artifact_evidence_project_claim_unq")
    .on(table.projectId, table.provider, table.externalId)
    .where(sql`counts_toward_slices = true`),
// The same bytes cannot fund two receipts.
uniqueIndex("physical_work_receipt_content_unq").on(table.projectId, table.contentSha256),
```

### 9.7 The pipeline and the queue

Every step is async (§4e). None can run in a request: transcription is minutes, LLM extraction is
seconds-to-minutes with provider retries, artifact grounding is a fan-out across four providers
with rate limits, AST parsing is CPU-bound, image forensics calls external services.

```text
submit claim (sync, 202) → transcribe-log → extract-claims → ground-artifacts
                         → analyze-substance → analyze-temporal → finalize-verdict
```

Each handler enqueues its successor on success. A `failed` or `flagged` step **still** enqueues
`finalize-verdict` — the pipeline always reaches a verdict, it never just stops.

The dequeue is the only correct form:

```sql
UPDATE verification_job SET state = 'leased', leased_until = NOW() + …, attempt_count = attempt_count + 1
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM verification_job
  WHERE state = 'queued' AND run_after <= NOW() AND kind = ANY($kinds)
  ORDER BY priority ASC, run_after ASC, id ASC   -- canonical, total ordering
  LIMIT $batchSize
  FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED                         -- non-negotiable; without it N workers serialize
) RETURNING *;
```

Retry backoff `min(2^attempt × 30s, 30min)` with ±20% jitter, so a provider outage does not produce
a synchronized herd on recovery. Retryable: 429/5xx/network/timeout. **Permanent:** 401
(consent revoked), 404 (artifact deleted upstream), schema-invalid LLM output after two repair
attempts — which sets the step `failed` and drives the verdict to `unverified-zero-slices`.

> **The failure mode is safe by default: a broken pipeline awards zero, never a guess.**

The verdict function is pure and exhaustive — any `failed` → `unverified-zero-slices`; any `flagged`
(no `failed`) → `flagged-for-review`; all `passed`/`skipped` → `verified`. Written once in
`src/lib/verdict.ts` with a `never` default, unit-tested over all 5⁴ combinations.

### 9.8 The dispute state machine

The proposal is created by `finalize-verdict`, **not** by the ledger. **No slices exist until a
window locks** — the 24-hour window is not an annotation on an award, it is a *precondition* for
one.

| From | To | Trigger | Who | Slices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | `open` | `finalize-verdict` | System | **None written.** `proposedSlices` frozen on the proposal, outside `totalSlices` |
| `open` | `disputed` | `POST …/dispute` | Any **active member**, including the subject. Not observers | `escrowedSlices = proposedSlices`; reported separately so the UI shows "frozen in escrow" honestly |
| `open` | `locked` | Expiry sweep | System | **Written.** One `award` entry at `proposedSlices` |
| `disputed` | `consensus-reached` | resolve `upheld` | Founder, or majority of `quorumMemberCount` | Released at full `proposedSlices` |
| `disputed` | `consensus-reached` | resolve `voided` | Founder / majority | Released at **0** — but a zero-slice entry *is still written* (no sequence holes) |
| `disputed` | `consensus-reached` | resolve `re-verified` | Founder / majority | Scoped re-verification run; settles at the **re-derived** number. The only path that changes the amount, and it comes from the formula |
| `disputed` | `open` | `withdrawn` before `windowClosesAt` | The **raiser only** | Original window resumes on its **original** clock — it does not restart, or serial withdraw/re-dispute holds slices hostage forever |
| `locked` | — | **nothing** | — | Terminal. Corrected only by appending a `reversal` |

Rejected with `409`: `locked → *`; `open → consensus-reached` (must pass through `disputed`); a
second dispute (`ALREADY_DISPUTED`); disputing after the window (`WINDOW_CLOSED`); anything at all
once the pie is baked.

**Expiry with no dispute** is the default path, so it must be boring and reliable. A 60-second sweep
over a partial index, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, re-asserting `status='open'` inside the transaction
(a dispute may land microseconds before the lock). Three properties that are easy to get wrong:

- **Downtime loses nothing.** The sweep queries persisted state, not a timer. A worker down six
  hours locks six hours of backlog on restart, all at correct amounts.
- **24 hours is a minimum, never a maximum.** A late sweep leaves the window open longer — always
  the safe direction. **Never pre-lock.**
- **Server UTC only.** `windowClosesAt` is computed in Postgres. "Locks in 9h 14m" is client
  arithmetic against the ISO instant; the server never sends a duration.

`flagged-for-review` **still opens a window.** The solar mock's `"960 slices withheld"` entry proves
it: a flagged verdict does not award, but it does post to the transparency ledger. If flagged claims
vanished silently, members would lose contributions with no recourse.

### 9.9 The hash chain

Hash input, in **fixed declared order**: `projectId`, `sequenceNumber`, `eventKind`, `actorUserId`,
`actorNameSnapshot`, `actorRoleSnapshot`, `actionLabel`, `targetLabel`, `detailNote` (`""`, never
null — `null` vs `""` changes the bytes), `payloadJson`, `occurredAt` (ISO-8601 UTC, exactly
milliseconds), `previousEntryHash`, `hashAlgorithmVersion`.

Deliberately **excluded**: `id` (a random UUID makes the chain unreproducible from semantics),
`createdAt` (write time ≠ event time), and every FK back-reference (circular).

**Serialization: RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme).** Not hand-rolled concatenation with a
delimiter — a delimiter is an injection surface (a `detailNote` containing it forges a chain), and
hand-rolled ordering drifts between the Node implementation and the Kotlin/Swift verifiers. JCS also
mandates integers-only serialization, which is a second reason nothing here is a float.

**Algorithm: SHA-256, lowercase hex, 64 characters.** `entryHashLabel: "c7d9a1"` is a *client-side
truncation for display*. 24 bits is trivially collidable and must never be compared.

**Appending takes a lock.** A chain has one writer per project, always:
`SELECT … FROM project_chain_head WHERE project_id = $1 FOR UPDATE` inside the transaction. Every
ledger write, rate lock, dispute transition, consent change and bake appends its audit entry **in
the same transaction** — an audit trail that can lag the ledger is worse than none.

**Verification: `GET /research-projects/:projectSlug/audit-trail/verify`** re-walks the chain and
checks three things per entry: the hash recomputes, the link matches the predecessor, and
`sequenceNumber` has no gap (a deleted row is a break even if every surviving hash is
self-consistent). A break returns **`409 CHAIN_BROKEN`**, not `200 {valid:false}` — a broken chain
is an operational emergency and must page.

> **The anti-theatre part.** A server that grades its own homework proves nothing. Three
> affordances make the chain independently verifiable: a `/hash-input` endpoint returning the
> canonical bytes so any client can SHA-256 them locally (five lines in `crypto.subtle`,
> `MessageDigest`, or `CryptoKit`); a list endpoint that returns every hash-input column so a
> client can canonicalize *without* trusting the server's bytes; and **daily external anchoring** of
> the head hash to append-only storage under a separate credential.
>
> Without the anchor, anyone with DB write access recomputes the whole chain from any point forward
> and every verification still passes. That is the honest limit of what a hash chain buys you:
> tamper-evident **against outsiders only**.

### 9.10 Consent and privacy

Consent is a **triple — (project, member, provider)** — never a pair. A member on three projects who
connects GitHub creates three independently revocable grants with independently narrowed
`allowedResourceIds`. A grant for the solar project must never be readable by the drone project's
pipeline. Scope narrowing is the difference between "Qatoto reads your work" and "Qatoto reads your
GitHub" — default to the narrowest scope the provider supports (a repo-scoped installation token,
not a user PAT).

Tokens are envelope-encrypted at rest with a KMS-held key. This deliberately diverges from Better
Auth's `account` table, which stores `accessToken` in plaintext — that is Better Auth's table and
its decision; these are third-party org-scoped tokens whose blast radius is a customer's entire
source repository.

**Revocation destroys the evidence, never the equity.**

- Every `slice_ledger_entry` is **untouched**. Slices awarded stay awarded, forever.
- `artifact_evidence.rawPayloadJson` → NULL, but `payloadSha256`, `externalId`, `label`,
  `artifactOccurredAt` and `signatureStatus` are **retained** — the claim stays provable ("commit
  `abc123` was signed, valid, at 14:02, hashing to `9f2e…`") without the platform holding a copy of
  anyone's code.
- Verification runs and steps survive intact. The audit story is preserved; the source data is gone.

**Why not claw back the slices** — two symmetric attacks, both fatal. *Member-side:* revoke on the
way out to force a re-verification that must now fail, then dispute the zero; equity becomes hostage
to consent. *Founder-side:* pressure a member into revoking to zero out their contribution — the
founder-fiat failure mode arriving through a side door. Slicing Pie agrees: a slice records **risk
already taken**, and risk taken in March is not undone by a token revoked in July.

The consequence a human must accept: a dispute against a claim with `evidenceRetained = false`
cannot re-derive a number, so it may resolve `upheld` or `voided` **only** — `re-verify` returns
`409 EVIDENCE_PURGED`. Surface this at the moment of revocation ("Revoking means these 47 claims can
no longer be re-checked if challenged").

Four further obligations, none of which exist yet:

- **Transcripts are personal data.** Retention policy + purge job (suggest: raw audio at 90 days,
  transcript while `dynamic`, purge at bake + 1 year).
- **Reverse-image search ships member photos to a third party.** Separate, explicit, per-project
  consent — never bundled into the OAuth grant. Without it the check is `not-applicable`, not
  silently uploaded.
- **`device_fingerprint` is biometric-adjacent** in some jurisdictions. Store a salted hash, never
  the raw EXIF serial.
- **Right to erasure vs. an immutable ledger.** These genuinely conflict. Resolution: `user` rows
  anonymize; `memberUserId` persists as an opaque id. But `actorNameSnapshot` is *inside the hash*
  and cannot be edited without breaking the chain — so **it must be pseudonymous at write time**.
  Get this right at the first write, or the chain and GDPR become mutually exclusive later.

### 9.11 Baking the pie

SPEC §3.4: at cash-flow breakeven or a priced round, dynamic calculation **stops** and percentages
freeze permanently.

`POST /research-projects/:projectSlug/pie-bake` requires a typed `acknowledgement: "BAKE THE PIE"`
and an `expectedSnapshotId` — if a newer snapshot exists, `409 SNAPSHOT_STALE`, because **a founder
must not bake a cap table they have not seen**. It rejects with `409 UNSETTLED_ALLOCATIONS` if any
proposal is `open` or `disputed`, forces a final synchronous recompute (pure integer math over
already-written rows), marks that snapshot `isBaked`, and appends a `pie-baked` audit entry.

`uniqueIndex("pie_bake_event_project_unq")` guarantees once, ever. **There is no unbake endpoint** —
recovery is a manual, audited, out-of-band operation.

### 9.12 An open decision for a human

§0 says the client never sends a server-owned value, explicitly including an hour count. That makes
it **impossible** for a consensus resolution to say *"we agreed it was 3 hours, not 4."*

The design above routes around it: `resolve` accepts a narrowed ISO-8601 **window**, and the server
re-derives minutes from artifact overlap inside it — preserving the rule and keeping the number
formula-produced. **That is the right default and this doc ships it.**

But it has a real cost. For **physical work with no digital artifacts**, there is nothing to overlap
a window against, so `re-verify` cannot produce a different number and the only outcomes are
all-or-nothing — on a claim the team may agree was *partially* valid. The solar mock depicts exactly
the disallowed case: `"Re-verified at 3 hrs — adjusted to 510 slices."`

Two options, to be decided knowingly:

- **(a) Keep the rule as written.** Physical-work disputes are binary; partial credit is achieved by
  voiding and re-submitting a smaller claim, which re-runs forensics. Stricter, and no number ever
  enters through a request body.
- **(b) Add a narrow, heavily-audited exception.** `consensusAdjustedMinutes`, accepted **only** on
  dispute resolution, **only** with `resolution: "re-verified"`, **only** after a majority of
  `quorumMemberCount` has voted, written as a `consensus-adjustment` ledger entry naming every voter
  in the audit payload. It is a human-supplied *input* to the formula — like the negotiated fair
  market rate, which §0 already tolerates at lock time — not a server-owned *output*.

This is the one place the stated rules genuinely pull against the product behaviour the mocks
depict. It needs a decision, not a default.

## 10. The data — Project Immortal

### It is a research program, not a research project

Firm recommendation: **model it as a distinct `research_program` entity**, not as a
`research_project` with a flag.

The two share almost nothing structurally. A `research_project` has one founder, a small closed
team, a funding round, milestones, escrow, and a Slicing Pie ledger over verified daily logs.
Project Immortal has 2,847 open contributors, a branch *tree*, a paper library, public discussion,
and contribution tracking that is not equity at all. Forcing them into one table means a dozen
nullable columns and an authorization model that has to branch on kind at every call site.

They do share the **contributor compensation vocabulary** (§4d `compensation_kind`) and the
`user` table. That is the correct amount of sharing.

### Program tables

| Table | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `research_program` | The singleton today; `slug`, stats sidecar |
| `immortal_research_branch` | The tree — see below |
| `immortal_branch_claim` | Who is working on which branch (drives `contributorCount`) |
| `immortal_research_paper` | Formal library; PDF, DOI, content hash |
| `immortal_post` | Informal posts **and** netizen ideas **and** replies — one table, self-referential `parentPostId` |
| `immortal_post_reaction` | One row per user per target; idempotent `PUT`/`DELETE` |
| `immortal_product_opportunity` | Monetizable derivations |
| `research_program_participant` | Contributors + `compensationPreference` |
| `research_effort_log` / `research_contribution_ledger_entry` | Effort and contribution tracking (`restrict` FKs — §4f) |
| `immortal_content_report` + `immortal_moderation_action` | Moderation |
| `research_program_stat_snapshot` | Job-computed program stats |

### The branch tree

**Adjacency list (`parentBranchId`) plus a materialized `ancestorPath`.** The read pattern is
"render the whole tree at once" for 12–38 nodes, so a closure table is overkill and `ltree` adds an
extension for no gain at this size. `ancestorPath` makes subtree queries a prefix match.

Same `COLLATE "C"` requirement as `workshop_task.rank` (§8) — the path's ordering is load-bearing
and must not follow database locale.

### `canvasPosition` is layout, not data

Same problem as the problem map's `mapPosition` (§6): `{ leftPercent, topPercent }` is hand-authored
layout for one specific SVG canvas. **The client should run a tidy-tree layout** from
`parentBranchId` + `siblingOrder`, so the graph renders correctly at any viewport on any platform.

An optional curator override survives as `pinnedLeftPermille` / `pinnedTopPermille` (integer
per-mille, normally NULL) for the handful of nodes a human wants placed deliberately.

### The derived analytical signals

`status: "missing"` (a research **gap** Qatoto highlights) and `overlappingGroupCount >= 2`
(duplicated work Qatoto flags) are the intellectual core of this surface — and they are **derived
analytical signals, not user-set fields**.

They are computed by a scheduled job from branch claims, paper coverage, and semantic similarity
between branch summaries, and they are **never** accepted in a request body. A contributor who could
mark their own branch "active" or a rival's "missing" would make the entire map worthless.

### Counts become integers

`reactionCountLabel: "418"`, `replyCountLabel: "37"`, `likeCountLabel: "482"` — all strings in the
mocks, all integers on the wire. The thousands separator is a client locale decision. `postedAtLabel:
"4 hours ago"` becomes `postedAt` ISO-8601, rendered via `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` /
`RelativeDateTimeFormatter` / `DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString`.

`isUploadedByViewer` is **computed per request** from `uploaderUserId === req.user?.id`, never a
column — it is a property of the *viewer*, not of the row.

`marketPotentialLabel: "$12B est. market"` becomes `estimatedMarketSizeInCents` — which **must** be
`bigint`: `1200000000000` is 560× the int4 ceiling (§4b). `readinessLabel: "Monetizable in 2–4 yrs"`
becomes `readinessMinMonths: 24` + `readinessMaxMonths: 48`, so the rail becomes sortable.

`ImmortalContributor.effortLabel` is the trap: it holds `"312 hrs logged"` in some rows and
`"Funding tranche 2 of 4"` in others. **One mock field, two meanings** — it splits into
`totalEffortMinutes` and `fundingTrancheIndex` / `fundingTrancheTotal`.

`ImmortalIdea.authorLocation` (`"Pune, India"`) has **no backing column on `user`** today. Either add
`user.locationLabel` or drop the field.

### Moderation and abuse

This is public UGC at the scale the program stats claim, so it needs real controls: paper uploads
deduplicated by DOI **and** content hash; likes idempotent and rate-limited (`PUT`/`DELETE`, not
`POST`, so a double-tap is harmless); reply threading depth-capped; and a moderation queue behind
the platform `moderator` role from §4a — which **does not exist yet**.

The current UI is further behind here than anywhere else on the surface: paper upload sends nothing
and hardcodes the category to `"longevity-biology"` and the author to `"You"`, and the like/reply
buttons in `idea-item.tsx` have `aria-label`s but **no `onClick` handler at all**.

---

## 11. The API

Mounted in `src/app.ts`, after `express.json()` — except the webhook router, which needs the **raw
body** for signature verification and must mount before it:

```ts
app.use("/webhooks", webhooksRouter); // BEFORE express.json() — raw body for signature checks
// … express.json() …
app.use("/research-projects", researchProjectsRouter);
app.use("/discovery", discoveryRouter);
app.use("/", fundingRouter); // /funding-rounds, /pledges, /milestones, /escrow-releases
app.use("/research-programs", researchProgramsRouter);
```

**Path convention, applied uniformly:** project-scoped resources nest under
`/research-projects/:projectSlug/…`. The public identity in a URL is always the **slug** (§5);
internal ids appear in payloads and in child path segments. Literal segments (`/mine`, `/slugs`)
are declared **before** `/:projectSlug` so they are never swallowed as a param — the same rule as the
users router's `/me` and the products router's `/mine`.

Unless stated otherwise every route is `requireAuth`, every project-scoped route additionally runs
`requireProjectRole` (§4a), and every mutation touching money/equity/effort adds
`requireIdentifiedUser` (§4a).

## 12. How a request flows

### Idea → published project

```text
1. Wizard finish → POST /research-projects { ideaName→name, oneLinePitch→tagline, categoryId,
                                             problemItSolves→problemStatement, targetRegion,
                                             demandEvidenceNotes, seedRolesNeeded[],
                                             offeredEquityBasisPointsMin/Max, expectedCommitment }
   → founderUserId from the session cookie/bearer, NEVER the body
   → slug server-generated from name; status='draft'
   → one txn: research_project + founder project_member + project_stats
   → 201

2. POST /research-projects/:slug/cover  (multipart) → sharp decode/re-encode → Cloudinary

3. POST /research-projects/:slug/publish
   → completeness gate: name + tagline + categoryId + problemStatement + cover
   → materializes one project_open_role per seedRolesNeeded entry
   → FREEZES the slug, sets publishedAt, status='active'
   → 200
```

### Pledge → escrow → milestone release (§7)

```text
POST /funding-rounds/:id/pledges { amountInCents }
  → re-bound against the round · derive fee · resolve currency · provider_transfer + idempotency key
  → post escrow_held → provider_clearing (settlement='pending')     [worker submits to Stripe]
POST /webhooks/payments/stripe   (signature-verified)
  → settlement='settled' · post provider_clearing → released_to_project
  → ONLY NOW raisedAmountInCents and backersCount move
POST /milestones/:id/escrow-releases { requestNote? }   ← no amount
  → snapshot milestone.escrowReleaseAmountInCents
POST /escrow-releases/:id/approve
  → requester ≠ approver · milestone done · POE verdict verified · window closed · balance sufficient
  → freeze the evidence into verificationSnapshot · append journal entry + postings summing to zero
```

### Daily log → slices (§8 → §9)

```text
POST …/daily-logs                 → Livepeer direct upload (backend never touches bytes)
POST …/daily-logs/:id/submit      → 202
  → transcribe-log → extract-claims → ground-artifacts → analyze-substance → analyze-temporal
  → finalize-verdict: pure verdict function; computeSlices → proposedSlices FROZEN on a proposal
  → slice_allocation_proposal opens; NOTHING is written to the ledger yet
[24 hours pass, no dispute]
  → expire-dispute-window sweep (60s) locks it: ONE slice_ledger_entry + audit append, same txn
  → recompute-equity-snapshot → largest-remainder apportionment → shares sum to exactly 10000
```

---

## 13. Zero-trust checklist

- Every actor id is **only** ever `req.user.id`. No `userId`, `founderUserId`, `backerUserId`,
  `memberUserId`, or `applicantUserId` field exists in any request schema.
- `requireAuth` is **not** treated as proof of a human — every money/equity/effort/distinct-count
  write additionally runs `requireIdentifiedUser` (§4a).
- Every project-scoped route re-checks membership in the **service** via `requireProjectRole`;
  failure → `NOT_FOUND` → `404`, never `403`, so ids cannot be probed.
- **No request body carries a price, equity share, slice count, hour count, score, verdict, or
  status.** The two deliberate exceptions are both *negotiated inputs*, not derived outputs, and both
  are documented as such: a founder's advertised equity band (§5) and a member-accepted fair market
  rate (§9).
- Pledges accept `{ amountInCents }` only, and the server still re-bounds it. Escrow releases accept
  **no amount at all**.
- `raisedAmountInCents`, `backersCount` and account balances are written by exactly **one** code
  path — the signature-verified webhook handler.
- Escrow release requires **two distinct people**, and `admin` cannot be self-granted.
- Equity is **computed, never asserted** — there is no writable equity column and no endpoint that
  sets one.
- Slice math is integer-only, rounded once, half-even, apportioned by largest remainder, and
  asserted to sum to exactly `10000`.
- Scores (`opportunityScore`, `demandScore`, investor confidence) are job-computed and returned with
  an `asOf`; they never appear in a body.
- Geography, country, file size, mimetype and image bytes are all **server-measured**, never
  client-claimed.
- Financial and audit tables are append-only, enforced by revoked grants **and** triggers **and**
  service discipline **and** the hash chain — and they never cascade.
- Every body/query is Zod `.safeParse()`d with `.strict()` → `422` before the service runs.

## 14. Frontend-behind-backend gaps

Backend supported, no UI yet:

- **Workshop writes.** The kanban is not draggable and the chat composer is a decorative `div`. No
  create-task, move-task, upload-file, or send-message affordance exists.
- **Dispute and consensus.** No dispute button, no vote UI, no quorum progress, no "who raised it".
- **Integration consent.** The entire connect / scope / revoke flow has **no frontend at all** —
  the single largest missing screen, and §9 cannot function without it.
- **Rate lock.** The fair market rate is the foundation of every number on the Proof-of-Effort page,
  and there is no UI to propose, review, lock, or view its history.
- **Pie bake.** No bake action, no pre-bake checklist, no frozen-cap-table view.
- **Chain verification.** No "Verify chain" action, no hash-input inspector. Without it, the
  hash-chain framing is decoration.
- **Override / review.** No surface for a founder to review a flagged step and override it.
- **Project edit.** `GET` + `PATCH` exist; there is no edit entry point.
- **Tiered / multi-currency funding, paper moderation queue, talent profile editing.**

Frontend-side work the contract forces:

- **Pagination everywhere.** `ProjectProofOfEffortLedger` is a flat object with unbounded arrays. A
  two-year-old project has thousands of entries.
- **Async states.** Claim submission returns `202`, not a verdict. The UI assumes verdicts exist
  synchronously; it needs pending states plus polling or SSE.
- **Idempotency keys** on claim submit, receipt upload and dispute raise, or a retried request on a
  flaky mobile connection duplicates.
- **Multiple verification attempts.** `ClaimVerificationRun` models one run; re-verification
  produces attempt 2+ and the UI would show stale results.

## 15. Frontend types that must change shape

Not just values — **shapes**. Every one is a compile error the migration must work through.

**`project.ts`** — `TeamMember` (`equityShare: "62%"` → `equityBasisPoints: 6200`;
`effortHoursLogged: 148` → `verifiedEffortMinutes: 8880`; `joinedDate` → `joinedAt` ISO; `id` slug →
`userId`; `isFounder` **removed**, derived from `projectRole`) · `CompensationComponent`
(`amountLabel` → a **discriminated union per kind** carrying typed integers; `earnedAsLabel` →
`earnedAsPolicy` enum) · `MilestoneVariance` (five labels → six typed integers + two unit nouns;
`varianceLabel: "26% behind"` → **signed** `varianceBasisPoints: -2600`) · `Milestone`
(`escrowReleaseAmount` → `…InCents`) · `FundingRound` (`goalAmount`/`raisedAmount` → cents;
**`percentageFunded` deleted**, computed on read) · `EscrowLedgerEntry` (`amount` → cents;
`direction` becomes derived from the posting sign) · `DailyLog` (`date` **splits** into `logDate` +
`submittedAt`; `isEffortVerified: boolean` → the six-value enum) · `ResearchProject`
(`founderId` slug → `founderUserId`; `coverImageSrc` → absolute URL; **`id` stays a slug,
deliberately**).

**`discovery.ts`** — `ProblemReport` (**`mapPosition` deleted entirely** → lat/lng microdegrees;
`category` string → `{ slug, displayLabel, pinIconKey }`; `reportedDate` → `firstReportedAt` +
`lastReportedAt`; `reportCount` → `distinctReporterCount`) · `MarketInsight` (`statValue` →
`statKind` + `statValueMilli` + `statUnitKey`; `sourceNote` → three fields) · `TalentProfile`
(`skills: string[]` → `{ slug, displayLabel, isVerified }[]` — which also fixes the live
substring-match bug; `effortHoursLogged` → minutes).

**`workshop.ts`** — `WorkshopFile` (`fileSizeLabel: "1.8 MB"` → `sizeBytes`) · `WorkshopTask`
(`dueDateLabel` → date-only ISO; **gains `rank`**) · `WorkshopChatMessage` (`sentAtLabel` → ISO with
microsecond precision — it is also the cursor).

**`immortal.ts`** — every `*CountLabel` → integer · every `*AtLabel` → ISO · `canvasPosition` →
topology · `marketPotentialLabel` → `bigint` cents · `readinessLabel` → two month integers ·
`effortLabel` **splits in two** (it holds two different meanings today) · `ProgramStat.statValue` →
integer + key.

**`proof-of-effort.ts`** — essentially every field; it is the file most fully composed of
pre-rendered strings and equations. Notably `timeSliceEquationLabel` → `{ verifiedMinutes,
lockedRateCentsPerHour, timeSlices }` with the **client composing the sentence** (so the `×` and the
currency localize) · `sliceSharePercent: 5.5` (a **float**) → `equityBasisPoints: 550` ·
`timeRemainingToLockLabel` → `windowClosesAt` ISO · `entryHashLabel: "a1f9c3"` → the full 64-char
`entryHash` · `slicesAwardedLabel: "960 slices withheld"` → `{ slicesAwarded: 0, proposedSlices: 960,
status }` — one prose string carrying two numbers and a state.

**Enums:** every shipped kebab-case union value becomes `snake_case` (§4d) — `"full-time"` →
`"full_time"`, `"one-time"` → `"one_time"`, `"market-research"` → `"market_research"`.

Also missing from the frontend entirely and needing new types: `VerificationStepStatus` has no
`failed` or `skipped`; `PhysicalReceiptVerdict` has no `pending`; `ImageForensicsCheckResult` has no
`not-applicable`; `evidenceLabels: string[]` needs identity; there is no `dispute_vote` concept, no
project-role concept, and no `escrowedSlices`.

## 16. Build order

Do **not** implement the domains in parallel — §9 defines the numbers every other section reads.

| Phase | Scope | Why here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0. Unblock** | `bearer()` plugin + multi-origin passkey/OAuth (§4a) · `requireIdentifiedUser` · `project_member` + `requireProjectRole` · `src/lib/money.ts` · `src/lib/canonical-hash.ts` · pg-boss + the worker process · shared enums (§4d) | Every phase below depends on all of it. Native clients are blocked entirely until the auth items land |
| **1. Projects & team** (§5) | Idea → project → publish → team → roles → applications | The spine. Everything else FKs to `research_project` |
| **2. Workshop & daily logs** (§8) | Board, files, chat, log capture + transcription | Produces the input §9 consumes |
| **3. Proof of Effort** (§9) | Rate lock → claims → pipeline → disputes → ledger → snapshots → bake | The hardest and highest-value. Its patterns get copied |
| **4. Funding & escrow** (§7) | Rounds, pledges, provider, ledger, releases | Highest stakes; depends on §9 verdicts for release gating. **Crowdfunding only** — equity/venture stay flag-disabled until Phase 4 of the business sequence |
| **5. Discovery** (§6) | Clusters, scoring jobs, insights, talent | Independent; deferrable without blocking anything |
| **6. Project Immortal** (§10) | Branches, papers, posts, moderation | Largest surface, lowest coupling. Needs the moderator role first |

This matches PROOF_OF_EFFORT_SPEC.md §1's business sequencing: the AI Chief of Staff (§9) is the
Phase-1 revenue product; reward crowdfunding (§7) is Year 1; equity crowdfunding is Year 3+ and
stays API-disabled until then.

---

## 17. Verification (when the backend phase begins)

1. `pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate`, then hand-add what Drizzle cannot express: the `COLLATE
   "C"` alterations (§8, §10), the append-only triggers and revoked grants (§4f, §7), and the
   partial unique indexes.
2. **Determinism suite, before anything else ships.** Run `recompute-equity-snapshot` 1,000 times
   with input rows shuffled and assert byte-identical `equity_snapshot_share` output. Assert
   `computeSlices` reproduces **every** figure in `solar-cold-storage.ts` (§9.2 lists them). Assert
   apportionment sums to exactly `10000` over randomized member sets, including ties.
3. **Chain suite.** Append 500 entries, verify; then tamper with one row's `detailNote` directly in
   SQL and assert `/audit-trail/verify` returns `409` naming that exact sequence. Delete a row and
   assert the gap is detected even though every surviving hash is self-consistent.
4. **The tampering test the user asked for.** Fetch a round, edit `amountInCents` in DevTools to a
   different currency's magnitude, replay the pledge — assert the server charges its own value and
   that every rejected key in §7 returns `422`. Repeat against the native clients with a proxy.
5. **Four-eyes test.** Founder requests a release and attempts to approve it → `422
   SELF_APPROVAL_FORBIDDEN`. Founder grants themselves `admin` → rejected.
6. **Dispute lifecycle.** Verify a claim, confirm nothing is in the ledger; let the window expire and
   confirm exactly one entry appears; re-run the sweep and confirm it is a no-op (idempotency);
   dispute another and confirm slices show as escrowed and *outside* `totalSlices`.
7. **Zero-trust sweep.** `grep` every Zod schema for `userId|equity|slice|Cents|score|verdict|status`
   and confirm each hit is one of the two documented negotiated-input exceptions.
8. **Cascade sweep.** For every FK into a financial or audit table, assert `onDelete` is `restrict`
   or `set null`. Then delete a test user with ledger history and confirm it fails loudly.
9. **Coverage sweep.** Every route in [R_AND_D_STRUCTURE.md](R_AND_D_STRUCTURE.md) §3 and every
   action in its §8/§9 maps to a named endpoint in §11.

```bash
# The core money-path smoke test
curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/research-projects -b cookies.txt \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"SolarChill","tagline":"Solar cold rooms","categoryId":"<id>",
       "problemStatement":"Produce spoils in transit"}'
# → 201, capture the slug

curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/funding-rounds/<id>/pledges -b cookies.txt \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"amountInCents":5000}'
# → 201; then confirm raisedAmountInCents has NOT moved until the webhook settles

curl -X POST https://localhost:8000/funding-rounds/<id>/pledges -b cookies.txt \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"amountInCents":5000,"currency":"CNY","backerUserId":"someone-else"}'
# → 422, both unknown keys rejected by .strict()
```
